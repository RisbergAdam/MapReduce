44:006:012 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the
           scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to
           the council,

44:006:013 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not
           to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the
           law:

44:006:014 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall
           destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses
           delivered us.

44:006:015 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him,
           saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

44:007:001 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?

44:007:002 And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of
           glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in
           Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,

44:007:003 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
           kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.

44:007:004 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in
           Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed
           him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.

44:007:005 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to
           set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him
           for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he
           had no child.

44:007:006 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a
           strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage,
           and entreat them evil four hundred years.

44:007:007 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge,
           said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me
           in this place.

44:007:008 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham
           begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac
           begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.

44:007:009 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt:
           but God was with him,

44:007:010 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him
           favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and
           he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.

44:007:011 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and
           Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no
           sustenance.

44:007:012 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out
           our fathers first.

44:007:013 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren;
           and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.

44:007:014 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all
           his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.

44:007:015 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,

44:007:016 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre
           that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor
           the father of Sychem.

44:007:017 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had
           sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

44:007:018 Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.

44:007:019 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated
           our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to
           the end they might not live.

44:007:020 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and
           nourished up in his father's house three months:

44:007:021 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and
           nourished him for her own son.

44:007:022 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and
           was mighty in words and in deeds.

44:007:023 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart
           to visit his brethren the children of Israel.

44:007:024 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and
           avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:

44:007:025 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that
           God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.

44:007:026 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove,
           and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are
           brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?

44:007:027 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying,
           Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?

44:007:028 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?

44:007:029 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land
           of Madian, where he begat two sons.

44:007:030 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in
           the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame
           of fire in a bush.

44:007:031 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew
           near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,

44:007:032 Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and
           the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled,
           and durst not behold.

44:007:033 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet:
           for the place where thou standest is holy ground.

44:007:034 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is
           in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to
           deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.

44:007:035 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler
           and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a
           deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in
           the bush.

44:007:036 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and
           signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the
           wilderness forty years.

44:007:037 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A
           prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your
           brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.

44:007:038 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the
           angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our
           fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:

44:007:039 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them,
           and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,

44:007:040 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for
           this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot
           not what is become of him.

44:007:041 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto
           the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

44:007:042 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of
           heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye
           house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and
           sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?

44:007:043 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your
           god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will
           carry you away beyond Babylon.

44:007:044 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness,
           as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make
           it according to the fashion that he had seen.

44:007:045 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus
           into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before
           the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;

44:007:046 Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle
           for the God of Jacob.

44:007:047 But Solomon built him an house.

44:007:048 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
           as saith the prophet,

44:007:049 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house
           will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my
           rest?

44:007:050 Hath not my hand made all these things?

44:007:051 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do
           always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.

44:007:052 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and
           they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the
           Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and
           murderers:

44:007:053 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and
           have not kept it.

44:007:054 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and
           they gnashed on him with their teeth.

44:007:055 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly
           into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on
           the right hand of God,

44:007:056 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
           standing on the right hand of God.

44:007:057 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
           and ran upon him with one accord,

44:007:058 And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the
           witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose
           name was Saul.

44:007:059 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
           Jesus, receive my spirit.

44:007:060 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
           not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he
           fell asleep.

44:008:001 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there
           was a great persecution against the church which was at
           Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the
           regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.

44:008:002 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
           lamentation over him.

44:008:003 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
           house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

44:008:004 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
           preaching the word.

44:008:005 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
           Christ unto them.

44:008:006 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
           which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he
           did.

44:008:007 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many
           that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies,
           and that were lame, were healed.

44:008:008 And there was great joy in that city.

44:008:009 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in
           the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of
           Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:

44:008:010 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,
           saying, This man is the great power of God.

44:008:011 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
           bewitched them with sorceries.

44:008:012 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning
           the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were
           baptized, both men and women.

44:008:013 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
           continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles
           and signs which were done.

44:008:014 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that
           Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them
           Peter and John:

44:008:015 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they
           might receive the Holy Ghost:

44:008:016 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were
           baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

44:008:017 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy
           Ghost.

44:008:018 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles'
           hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,

44:008:019 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay
           hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.

44:008:020 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
           thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with
           money.

44:008:021 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart
           is not right in the sight of God.

44:008:022 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if
           perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

44:008:023 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in
           the bond of iniquity.

44:008:024 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me,
           that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

44:008:025 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
           Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many
           villages of the Samaritans.

44:008:026 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise,
           and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from
           Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.

44:008:027 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an
           eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the
           Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had
           come to Jerusalem for to worship,

44:008:028 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
           prophet.

44:008:029 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
           this chariot.

44:008:030 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
           Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?

44:008:031 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And
           he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

44:008:032 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led
           as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his
           shearer, so opened he not his mouth:

44:008:033 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall
           declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.

44:008:034 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
           speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?

44:008:035 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture,
           and preached unto him Jesus.

44:008:036 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
           and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me
           to be baptized?

44:008:037 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
           mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ
           is the Son of God.

44:008:038 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went
           down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he
           baptized him.

44:008:039 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
           Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and
           he went on his way rejoicing.

44:008:040 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he
           preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

44:009:001 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
           the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,

44:009:002 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that
           if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women,
           he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

44:009:003 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
           shined round about him a light from heaven:

44:009:004 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
           Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

44:009:005 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus
           whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the
           pricks.

44:009:006 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou
           have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into
           the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.

44:009:007 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing
           a voice, but seeing no man.

44:009:008 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,
           he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him
           into Damascus.

44:009:009 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
           drink.

44:009:010 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias;
           and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said,
           Behold, I am here, Lord.

44:009:011 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street
           which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas
           for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,

44:009:012 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and
           putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.

44:009:013 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man,
           how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:

44:009:014 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all
           that call on thy name.

44:009:015 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen
           vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and
           kings, and the children of Israel:

44:009:016 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my
           name's sake.

44:009:017 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and
           putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even
           Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath
           sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled
           with the Holy Ghost.

44:009:018 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been
           scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was
           baptized.

44:009:019 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was
           Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.

44:009:020 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he
           is the Son of God.

44:009:021 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he
           that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem,
           and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them
           bound unto the chief priests?

44:009:022 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the
           Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very
           Christ.

44:009:023 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel
           to kill him:

44:009:024 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the
           gates day and night to kill him.

44:009:025 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the
           wall in a basket.

44:009:026 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join
           himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and
           believed not that he was a disciple.

44:009:027 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and
           declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and
           that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at
           Damascus in the name of Jesus.

44:009:028 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.

44:009:029 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
           disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay
           him.

44:009:030 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to
           Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.

44:009:031 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee
           and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the
           Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.

44:009:032 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters,
           he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.

44:009:033 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept
           his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.

44:009:034 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee
           whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.

44:009:035 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to
           the Lord.

44:009:036 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which
           by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of
           good works and almsdeeds which she did.

44:009:037 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and
           died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper
           chamber.

44:009:038 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples
           had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men,
           desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.

44:009:039 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they
           brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood
           by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which
           Dorcas made, while she was with them.

44:009:040 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed;
           and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she
           opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

44:009:041 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had
           called the saints and widows, presented her alive.

44:009:042 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in
           the Lord.

44:009:043 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with
           one Simon a tanner.

44:010:001 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a
           centurion of the band called the Italian band,

44:010:002 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house,
           which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.

44:010:003 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day
           an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him,
           Cornelius.

44:010:004 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is
           it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are
           come up for a memorial before God.

44:010:005 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose
           surname is Peter:

44:010:006 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea
           side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.

44:010:007 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he
           called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of
           them that waited on him continually;

44:010:008 And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent
           them to Joppa.

44:010:009 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh
           unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about
           the sixth hour:

44:010:010 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while
           they made ready, he fell into a trance,

44:010:011 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon
           him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners,
           and let down to the earth:

44:010:012 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and
           wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

44:010:013 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.

44:010:014 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
           that is common or unclean.

44:010:015 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God
           hath cleansed, that call not thou common.

44:010:016 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again
           into heaven.

44:010:017 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he
           had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from
           Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before
           the gate,

44:010:018 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter,
           were lodged there.

44:010:019 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
           Behold, three men seek thee.

44:010:020 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
           nothing: for I have sent them.

44:010:021 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
           Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the
           cause wherefore ye are come?

44:010:022 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one
           that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of
           the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for
           thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.

44:010:023 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow
           Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa
           accompanied him.

44:010:024 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
           waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and
           near friends.

44:010:025 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down
           at his feet, and worshipped him.

44:010:026 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a
           man.

44:010:027 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that
           were come together.

44:010:028 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful
           thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto
           one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should
           not call any man common or unclean.

44:010:029 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was
           sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?

44:010:030 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this
           hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold,
           a man stood before me in bright clothing,

44:010:031 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are
           had in remembrance in the sight of God.

44:010:032 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname
           is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by
           the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.

44:010:033 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
           that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present
           before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.

44:010:034 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
           that God is no respecter of persons:

44:010:035 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh
           righteousness, is accepted with him.

44:010:036 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
           peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)

44:010:037 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all
           Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John
           preached;

44:010:038 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
           with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that
           were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

44:010:039 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the
           land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged
           on a tree:

44:010:040 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;

44:010:041 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God,
           even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from
           the dead.

44:010:042 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
           that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of
           quick and dead.

44:010:043 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
           whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

44:010:044 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
           them which heard the word.

44:010:045 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
           as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also
           was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.

44:010:046 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
           answered Peter,

44:010:047 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
           which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?

44:010:048 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.
           Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.

44:011:001 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that
           the Gentiles had also received the word of God.

44:011:002 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
           circumcision contended with him,

44:011:003 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat
           with them.

44:011:004 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and
           expounded it by order unto them, saying,

44:011:005 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a
           vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great
           sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even
           to me:

44:011:006 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered,
           and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and
           creeping things, and fowls of the air.

44:011:007 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and
           eat.

44:011:008 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath
           at any time entered into my mouth.

44:011:009 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
           cleansed, that call not thou common.

44:011:010 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again
           into heaven.

44:011:011 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come
           unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.

44:011:012 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting.
           Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered
           into the man's house:

44:011:013 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which
           stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for
           Simon, whose surname is Peter;

44:011:014 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house
           shall be saved.

44:011:015 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
           at the beginning.

44:011:016 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
           indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the
           Holy Ghost.

44:011:017 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto
           us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I
           could withstand God?

44:011:018 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and
           glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles
           granted repentance unto life.

44:011:019 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
           arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus,
           and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews
           only.

44:011:020 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when
           they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching
           the LORD Jesus.

44:011:021 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
           believed, and turned unto the Lord.

44:011:022 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
           which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he
           should go as far as Antioch.

44:011:023 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad,
           and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would
           cleave unto the Lord.

44:011:024 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of
           faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.

44:011:025 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:

44:011:026 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it
           came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with
           the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were
           called Christians first in Antioch.

44:011:027 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.

44:011:028 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
           the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all
           the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

44:011:029 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
           determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in
           Judaea:

44:011:030 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
           Barnabas and Saul.

44:012:001 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands
           to vex certain of the church.

44:012:002 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

44:012:003 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
           to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)

44:012:004 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and
           delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him;
           intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.

44:012:005 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made
           without ceasing of the church unto God for him.

44:012:006 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
           Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two
           chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.

44:012:007 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
           shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and
           raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell
           off from his hands.

44:012:008 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
           sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy
           garment about thee, and follow me.

44:012:009 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was
           true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.

44:012:010 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
           unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to
           them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on
           through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.

44:012:011 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
           surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered
           me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of
           the people of the Jews.

44:012:012 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of
           Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many
           were gathered together praying.

44:012:013 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
           hearken, named Rhoda.

44:012:014 And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for
           gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the
           gate.

44:012:015 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
           affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.

44:012:016 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the
           door, and saw him, they were astonished.

44:012:017 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
           declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the
           prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to
           the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.

44:012:018 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
           soldiers, what was become of Peter.

44:012:019 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
           examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to
           death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there
           abode.

44:012:020 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon:
           but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus
           the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because
           their country was nourished by the king's country.

44:012:021 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon
           his throne, and made an oration unto them.

44:012:022 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god,
           and not of a man.

44:012:023 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he
           gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up
           the ghost.

44:012:024 But the word of God grew and multiplied.

44:012:025 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
           fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose
           surname was Mark.

44:013:001 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain
           prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called
           Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been
           brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

44:013:002 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost
           said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I
           have called them.

44:013:003 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
           them, they sent them away.

44:013:004 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
           Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

44:013:005 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God
           in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their
           minister.

44:013:006 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they
           found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name
           was Barjesus:

44:013:007 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
           prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to
           hear the word of God.

44:013:008 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
           withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the
           faith.

44:013:009 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy
           Ghost, set his eyes on him.

44:013:010 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child
           of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not
           cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

44:013:011 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou
           shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And
           immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he
           went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

44:013:012 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
           astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

44:013:013 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to
           Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to
           Jerusalem.

44:013:014 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
           Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and
           sat down.

44:013:015 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers
           of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren,
           if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.

44:013:016 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
           Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

44:013:017 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and
           exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of
           Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.

44:013:018 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in
           the wilderness.

44:013:019 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of
           Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.

44:013:020 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of
           four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

44:013:021 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul
           the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space
           of forty years.

44:013:022 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to
           be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said,
           I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own
           heart, which shall fulfil all my will.

44:013:023 Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised
           unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:

44:013:024 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of
           repentance to all the people of Israel.

44:013:025 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that
           I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me,
           whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.

44:013:026 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and
           whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this
           salvation sent.

44:013:027 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because
           they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which
           are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in
           condemning him.

44:013:028 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired
           they Pilate that he should be slain.

44:013:029 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
           took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.

44:013:030 But God raised him from the dead:

44:013:031 And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from
           Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.

44:013:032 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise
           which was made unto the fathers,

44:013:033 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he
           hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the
           second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

44:013:034 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no
           more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will
           give you the sure mercies of David.

44:013:035 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not
           suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

44:013:036 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will
           of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw
           corruption:

44:013:037 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.

44:013:038 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
           this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:

44:013:039 And by him all that believe are justified from all things,
           from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

44:013:040 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of
           in the prophets;

44:013:041 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a
           work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe,
           though a man declare it unto you.

44:013:042 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
           besought that these words might be preached to them the next
           sabbath.

44:013:043 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
           religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking
           to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

44:013:044 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together
           to hear the word of God.

44:013:045 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
           envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by
           Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.

44:013:046 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
           that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but
           seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of
           everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.

44:013:047 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to
           be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for
           salvation unto the ends of the earth.

44:013:048 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and
           glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained
           to eternal life believed.

44:013:049 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
           region.

44:013:050 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and
           the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul
           and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.

44:013:051 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and
           came unto Iconium.

44:013:052 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy
           Ghost.

44:014:001 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together
           into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great
           multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.

44:014:002 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made
           their minds evil affected against the brethren.

44:014:003 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord,
           which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted
           signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

44:014:004 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with
           the Jews, and part with the apostles.

44:014:005 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and
           also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully,
           and to stone them,

44:014:006 They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities
           of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:

44:014:007 And there they preached the gospel.

44:014:008 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
           being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:

44:014:009 The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
           perceiving that he had faith to be healed,

44:014:010 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he
           leaped and walked.

44:014:011 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
           their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are
           come down to us in the likeness of men.

44:014:012 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius,
           because he was the chief speaker.

44:014:013 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city,
           brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done
           sacrifice with the people.

44:014:014 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they
           rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,

44:014:015 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of
           like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should
           turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made
           heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are
           therein:

44:014:016 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
           ways.

44:014:017 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he
           did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
           filling our hearts with food and gladness.

44:014:018 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that
           they had not done sacrifice unto them.

44:014:019 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
           who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out
           of the city, supposing he had been dead.

44:014:020 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up,
           and came into the city: and the next day he departed with
           Barnabas to Derbe.

44:014:021 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
           taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium,
           and Antioch,

44:014:022 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to
           continue in the faith, and that we must through much
           tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

44:014:023 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and
           had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on
           whom they believed.

44:014:024 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
           Pamphylia.

44:014:025 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
           into Attalia:

44:014:026 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been
           recommended to the grace of God for the work which they
           fulfilled.

44:014:027 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,
           they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had
           opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

44:014:028 And there they abode long time with the disciples.

44:015:001 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the
           brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner
           of Moses, ye cannot be saved.

44:015:002 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
           disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas,
           and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the
           apostles and elders about this question.

44:015:003 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed
           through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the
           Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.

44:015:004 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of
           the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared
           all things that God had done with them.

44:015:005 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
           believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and
           to command them to keep the law of Moses.

44:015:006 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of
           this matter.

44:015:007 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and
           said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good
           while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my
           mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.

44:015:008 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving
           them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;

44:015:009 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
           hearts by faith.

44:015:010 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of
           the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to
           bear?

44:015:011 But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ
           we shall be saved, even as they.

44:015:012 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
           Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had
           wrought among the Gentiles by them.

44:015:013 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying,
           Men and brethren, hearken unto me:

44:015:014 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the
           Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.

44:015:015 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,

44:015:016 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle
           of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the
           ruins thereof, and I will set it up:

44:015:017 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the
           Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who
           doeth all these things.

44:015:018 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
           world.

44:015:019 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
           among the Gentiles are turned to God:

44:015:020 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions
           of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and
           from blood.

44:015:021 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him,
           being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

44:015:022 Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,
           to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul
           and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief
           men among the brethren:

44:015:023 And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles
           and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which
           are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

44:015:024 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from
           us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls,
           saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we
           gave no such commandment:

44:015:025 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to
           send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

44:015:026 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord
           Jesus Christ.

44:015:027 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell
           you the same things by mouth.

44:015:028 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon
           you no greater burden than these necessary things;

44:015:029 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,
           and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if
           ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.

44:015:030 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when
           they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the
           epistle:

44:015:031 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.

44:015:032 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
           the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.

44:015:033 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in
           peace from the brethren unto the apostles.

44:015:034 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.

44:015:035 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
           preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

44:015:036 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again
           and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached
           the word of the LORD, and see how they do.

44:015:037 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
           was Mark.

44:015:038 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
           from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.

44:015:039 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they
           departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took
           Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;

44:015:040 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the
           brethren unto the grace of God.

44:015:041 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the
           churches.

44:016:001 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain
           disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain
           woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a
           Greek:

44:016:002 Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra
           and Iconium.

44:016:003 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and
           circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those
           quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.

44:016:004 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
           decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and
           elders which were at Jerusalem.

44:016:005 And so were the churches established in the faith, and
           increased in number daily.

44:016:006 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
           Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the
           word in Asia,

44:016:007 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into
           Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.

44:016:008 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.

44:016:009 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man
           of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into
           Macedonia, and help us.

44:016:010 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured
           to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had
           called us for to preach the gospel unto them.

44:016:011 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course
           to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;

44:016:012 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that
           part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city
           abiding certain days.

44:016:013 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
           where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake
           unto the women which resorted thither.

44:016:014 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the
           city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart
           the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were
           spoken of Paul.

44:016:015 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
           saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come
           into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.

44:016:016 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
           possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought
           her masters much gain by soothsaying:

44:016:017 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men
           are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the
           way of salvation.

44:016:018 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned
           and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus
           Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.

44:016:019 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was
           gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the
           marketplace unto the rulers,

44:016:020 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being
           Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,

44:016:021 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive,
           neither to observe, being Romans.

44:016:022 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the
           magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat
           them.

44:016:023 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them
           into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:

44:016:024 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner
           prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.

44:016:025 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
           God: and the prisoners heard them.

44:016:026 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
           foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the
           doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.

44:016:027 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
           seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would
           have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been
           fled.

44:016:028 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:
           for we are all here.

44:016:029 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
           and fell down before Paul and Silas,

44:016:030 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be
           saved?

44:016:031 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
           shalt be saved, and thy house.

44:016:032 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
           were in his house.

44:016:033 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
           stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.

44:016:034 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat
           before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his
           house.

44:016:035 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants,
           saying, Let those men go.

44:016:036 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
           magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and
           go in peace.

44:016:037 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly
           uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and
           now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them
           come themselves and fetch us out.

44:016:038 And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
           they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.

44:016:039 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and
           desired them to depart out of the city.

44:016:040 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of
           Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted
           them, and departed.

44:017:001 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
           they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:

44:017:002 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three
           sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,

44:017:003 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered,
           and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I
           preach unto you, is Christ.

44:017:004 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas;
           and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief
           women not a few.

44:017:005 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto
           them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a
           company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the
           house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.

44:017:006 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
           brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have
           turned the world upside down are come hither also;

44:017:007 Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the
           decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one
           Jesus.

44:017:008 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
           they heard these things.

44:017:009 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other,
           they let them go.

44:017:010 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
           unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the
           Jews.

44:017:011 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
           received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
           scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

44:017:012 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women
           which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.

44:017:013 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
           of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also,
           and stirred up the people.

44:017:014 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
           were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.

44:017:015 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
           receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come
           to him with all speed, they departed.

44:017:016 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was
           stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

44:017:017 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
           the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met
           with him.

44:017:018 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the
           Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this
           babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of
           strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the
           resurrection.

44:017:019 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
           we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?

44:017:020 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would
           know therefore what these things mean.

44:017:021 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
           their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear
           some new thing.)

44:017:022 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men
           of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
           superstitious.

44:017:023 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an
           altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom
           therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.

44:017:024 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
           is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
           hands;

44:017:025 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed
           any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
           things;

44:017:026 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on
           all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times
           before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;

44:017:027 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after
           him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:

44:017:028 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
           also of your own poets have said, For we are also his
           offspring.

44:017:029 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
           think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
           graven by art and man's device.

44:017:030 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
           commandeth all men every where to repent:

44:017:031 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
           the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained;
           whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath
           raised him from the dead.

44:017:032 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
           mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this
           matter.

44:017:033 So Paul departed from among them.

44:017:034 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
           which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris,
           and others with them.

44:018:001 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
           Corinth;

44:018:002 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately
           come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that
           Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came
           unto them.

44:018:003 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
           wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

44:018:004 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded
           the Jews and the Greeks.

44:018:005 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul
           was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that
           Jesus was Christ.

44:018:006 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
           raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own
           heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the
           Gentiles.

44:018:007 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's
           house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house
           joined hard to the synagogue.

44:018:008 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
           Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing
           believed, and were baptized.

44:018:009 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
           afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:

44:018:010 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee:
           for I have much people in this city.

44:018:011 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the
           word of God among them.

44:018:012 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
           insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to
           the judgment seat,

44:018:013 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to
           the law.

44:018:014 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said
           unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked
           lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:

44:018:015 But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law,
           look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.

44:018:016 And he drave them from the judgment seat.

44:018:017 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
           synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio
           cared for none of those things.

44:018:018 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
           took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria,
           and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in
           Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

44:018:019 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
           entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

44:018:020 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
           consented not;

44:018:021 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this
           feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto
           you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

44:018:022 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted
           the church, he went down to Antioch.

44:018:023 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went
           over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order,
           strengthening all the disciples.

44:018:024 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an
           eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

44:018:025 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
           fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the
           things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

44:018:026 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when
           Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and
           expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.

44:018:027 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
           wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he
           was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:

44:018:028 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly,
           shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

44:019:001 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
           having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and
           finding certain disciples,

44:019:002 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
           believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard
           whether there be any Holy Ghost.

44:019:003 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And
           they said, Unto John's baptism.

44:019:004 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
           repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe
           on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.

44:019:005 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the
           Lord Jesus.

44:019:006 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost
           came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.

44:019:007 And all the men were about twelve.

44:019:008 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space
           of three months, disputing and persuading the things
           concerning the kingdom of God.

44:019:009 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake
           evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them,
           and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of
           one Tyrannus.

44:019:010 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
           which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both
           Jews and Greeks.

44:019:011 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:

44:019:012 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
           or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil
           spirits went out of them.

44:019:013 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them
           to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD
           Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.

44:019:014 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of
           the priests, which did so.

44:019:015 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul
           I know; but who are ye?

44:019:016 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and
           overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled
           out of that house naked and wounded.

44:019:017 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
           Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord
           Jesus was magnified.

44:019:018 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
           deeds.

44:019:019 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
           together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the
           price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.

44:019:020 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

44:019:021 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit,
           when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to
           Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see
           Rome.

44:019:022 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto
           him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for
           a season.

44:019:023 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.

44:019:024 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
           silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the
           craftsmen;

44:019:025 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation,
           and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.

44:019:026 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but
           almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and
           turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which
           are made with hands:

44:019:027 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at
           nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana
           should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed,
           whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.

44:019:028 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath,
           and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

44:019:029 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having
           caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's
           companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the
           theatre.

44:019:030 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the
           disciples suffered him not.

44:019:031 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent
           unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself
           into the theatre.

44:019:032 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
           assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore
           they were come together.

44:019:033 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
           him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would
           have made his defence unto the people.

44:019:034 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
           the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the
           Ephesians.

44:019:035 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye
           men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that
           the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess
           Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?

44:019:036 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye
           ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.

44:019:037 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither
           robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.

44:019:038 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
           have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are
           deputies: let them implead one another.

44:019:039 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
           be determined in a lawful assembly.

44:019:040 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's
           uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of
           this concourse.

44:019:041 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

44:020:001 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
           disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into
           Macedonia.

44:020:002 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
           exhortation, he came into Greece,

44:020:003 And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for
           him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return
           through Macedonia.

44:020:004 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of
           the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of
           Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

44:020:005 These going before tarried for us at Troas.

44:020:006 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
           bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we
           abode seven days.

44:020:007 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
           together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to
           depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.

44:020:008 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they
           were gathered together.

44:020:009 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
           being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long
           preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the
           third loft, and was taken up dead.

44:020:010 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
           Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.

44:020:011 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
           eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
           departed.

44:020:012 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
           comforted.

44:020:013 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
           intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding
           himself to go afoot.

44:020:014 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
           Mitylene.

44:020:015 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against
           Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at
           Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.

44:020:016 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would
           not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible
           for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.

44:020:017 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of
           the church.

44:020:018 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know,
           from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I
           have been with you at all seasons,

44:020:019 Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many
           tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait
           of the Jews:

44:020:020 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but
           have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house
           to house,

44:020:021 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,
           repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

44:020:022 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
           knowing the things that shall befall me there:

44:020:023 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that
           bonds and afflictions abide me.

44:020:024 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
           unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and
           the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to
           testify the gospel of the grace of God.

44:020:025 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
           preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

44:020:026 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from
           the blood of all men.

44:020:027 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
           God.

44:020:028 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
           over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
           the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.

44:020:029 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
           enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

44:020:030 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
           things, to draw away disciples after them.

44:020:031 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
           years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.

44:020:032 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of
           his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an
           inheritance among all them which are sanctified.

44:020:033 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

44:020:034 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto
           my necessities, and to them that were with me.

44:020:035 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought
           to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord
           Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to
           receive.

44:020:036 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
           them all.

44:020:037 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed
           him,

44:020:038 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
           should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the
           ship.

44:021:001 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and
           had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and
           the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:

44:021:002 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard,
           and set forth.

44:021:003 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left
           hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the
           ship was to unlade her burden.

44:021:004 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said
           to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to
           Jerusalem.

44:021:005 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went
           our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and
           children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on
           the shore, and prayed.

44:021:006 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship;
           and they returned home again.

44:021:007 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
           Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one
           day.

44:021:008 And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and
           came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip
           the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with
           him.

44:021:009 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did
           prophesy.

44:021:010 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea
           a certain prophet, named Agabus.

44:021:011 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound
           his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost,
           So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this
           girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

44:021:012 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that
           place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.

44:021:013 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
           heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at
           Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

44:021:014 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The
           will of the Lord be done.

44:021:015 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
           Jerusalem.

44:021:016 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
           and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple,
           with whom we should lodge.

44:021:017 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
           gladly.

44:021:018 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
           the elders were present.

44:021:019 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
           things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

44:021:020 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
           him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are
           which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:

44:021:021 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews
           which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that
           they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk
           after the customs.

44:021:022 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
           for they will hear that thou art come.

44:021:023 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
           have a vow on them;

44:021:024 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges
           with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know
           that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,
           are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and
           keepest the law.

44:021:025 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
           concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they
           keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood,
           and from strangled, and from fornication.

44:021:026 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
           with them entered into the temple, to signify the
           accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an
           offering should be offered for every one of them.

44:021:027 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
           of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
           people, and laid hands on him,

44:021:028 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that
           teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law,
           and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the
           temple, and hath polluted this holy place.

44:021:029 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
           Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the
           temple.)

44:021:030 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
           they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith
           the doors were shut.

44:021:031 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the
           chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an
           uproar.

44:021:032 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down
           unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the
           soldiers, they left beating of Paul.

44:021:033 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
           him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and
           what he had done.

44:021:034 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude:
           and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he
           commanded him to be carried into the castle.

44:021:035 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
           of the soldiers for the violence of the people.

44:021:036 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
           with him.

44:021:037 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
           chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou
           speak Greek?

44:021:038 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an
           uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men
           that were murderers?

44:021:039 But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in
           Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee,
           suffer me to speak unto the people.

44:021:040 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs,
           and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was
           made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue,
           saying,

44:022:001 Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make
           now unto you.

44:022:002 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to
           them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)

44:022:003 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in
           Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,
           and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the
           fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.

44:022:004 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and
           delivering into prisons both men and women.

44:022:005 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the
           estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto
           the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were
           there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.

44:022:006 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
           nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from
           heaven a great light round about me.

44:022:007 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
           Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

44:022:008 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am
           Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.

44:022:009 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were
           afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.

44:022:010 And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,
           Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee
           of all things which are appointed for thee to do.

44:022:011 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
           led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into
           Damascus.

44:022:012 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a
           good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,

44:022:013 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul,
           receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.

44:022:014 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that
           thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and
           shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.

44:022:015 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
           seen and heard.

44:022:016 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash
           away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

44:022:017 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
           even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;

44:022:018 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly
           out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony
           concerning me.

44:022:019 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in
           every synagogue them that believed on thee:

44:022:020 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was
           standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the
           raiment of them that slew him.

44:022:021 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence
           unto the Gentiles.

44:022:022 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up
           their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the
           earth: for it is not fit that he should live.

44:022:023 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw
           dust into the air,

44:022:024 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle,
           and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he
           might know wherefore they cried so against him.

44:022:025 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the
           centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man
           that is a Roman, and uncondemned?

44:022:026 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief
           captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a
           Roman.

44:022:027 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
           thou a Roman? He said, Yea.

44:022:028 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I
           this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.

44:022:029 Then straightway they departed from him which should have
           examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he
           knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

44:022:030 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty
           wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his
           bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council
           to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

44:023:001 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and
           brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until
           this day.

44:023:002 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him
           to smite him on the mouth.

44:023:003 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited
           wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and
           commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?

44:023:004 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?

44:023:005 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high
           priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the
           ruler of thy people.

44:023:006 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and
           the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and
           brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope
           and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.

44:023:007 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
           Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.

44:023:008 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
           angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.

44:023:009 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the
           Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in
           this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let
           us not fight against God.

44:023:010 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
           fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them,
           commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force
           from among them, and to bring him into the castle.

44:023:011 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of
           good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in
           Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.

44:023:012 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and
           bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither
           eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.

44:023:013 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.

44:023:014 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We
           have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat
           nothing until we have slain Paul.

44:023:015 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
           that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would
           enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or
           ever he come near, are ready to kill him.

44:023:016 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he
           went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.

44:023:017 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said,
           Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a
           certain thing to tell him.

44:023:018 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and
           said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to
           bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto
           thee.

44:023:019 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him
           aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell
           me?

44:023:020 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
           wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though
           they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.

44:023:021 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
           of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with
           an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have
           killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from
           thee.

44:023:022 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and
           charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these
           things to me.

44:023:023 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two
           hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore
           and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the
           night;

44:023:024 And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring
           him safe unto Felix the governor.

44:023:025 And he wrote a letter after this manner:

44:023:026 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth
           greeting.

44:023:027 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of
           them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having
           understood that he was a Roman.

44:023:028 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
           him, I brought him forth into their council:

44:023:029 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but
           to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of
           bonds.

44:023:030 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the
           man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his
           accusers also to say before thee what they had against him.
           Farewell.

44:023:031 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
           brought him by night to Antipatris.

44:023:032 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
           returned to the castle:

44:023:033 Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to
           the governor, presented Paul also before him.

44:023:034 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what
           province he was. And when he understood that he was of
           Cilicia;

44:023:035 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.
           And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

44:024:001 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
           elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who
           informed the governor against Paul.

44:024:002 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,
           saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that
           very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,

44:024:003 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with
           all thankfulness.

44:024:004 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I
           pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few
           words.

44:024:005 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
           sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a
           ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:

44:024:006 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took,
           and would have judged according to our law.

44:024:007 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great
           violence took him away out of our hands,

44:024:008 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of
           whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things,
           whereof we accuse him.

44:024:009 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

44:024:010 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
           speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of
           many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully
           answer for myself:

44:024:011 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
           twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.

44:024:012 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any
           man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues,
           nor in the city:

44:024:013 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.

44:024:014 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they
           call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all
           things which are written in the law and in the prophets:

44:024:015 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow,
           that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the
           just and unjust.

44:024:016 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
           void to offence toward God, and toward men.

44:024:017 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
           offerings.

44:024:018 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
           temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.

44:024:019 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they
           had ought against me.

44:024:020 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil
           doing in me, while I stood before the council,

44:024:021 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among
           them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in
           question by you this day.

44:024:022 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect
           knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias
           the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost
           of your matter.

44:024:023 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
           liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to
           minister or come unto him.

44:024:024 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife
           Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him
           concerning the faith in Christ.

44:024:025 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment
           to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this
           time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

44:024:026 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
           that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the
           oftener, and communed with him.

44:024:027 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and
           Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

44:025:001 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days
           he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

44:025:002 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
           against Paul, and besought him,

44:025:003 And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to
           Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.

44:025:004 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
           that he himself would depart shortly thither.

44:025:005 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
           with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in
           him.

44:025:006 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
           down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment
           seat commanded Paul to be brought.

44:025:007 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
           stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints
           against Paul, which they could not prove.

44:025:008 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
           Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have
           I offended any thing at all.

44:025:009 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul,
           and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of
           these things before me?

44:025:010 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I
           ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou
           very well knowest.

44:025:011 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
           death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these
           things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto
           them. I appeal unto Caesar.

44:025:012 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
           Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.

44:025:013 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
           Caesarea to salute Festus.

44:025:014 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's
           cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in
           bonds by Felix:

44:025:015 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the
           elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment
           against him.

44:025:016 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
           deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have
           the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for
           himself concerning the crime laid against him.

44:025:017 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on
           the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man
           to be brought forth.

44:025:018 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
           accusation of such things as I supposed:

44:025:019 But had certain questions against him of their own
           superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul
           affirmed to be alive.

44:025:020 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
           whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
           matters.

44:025:021 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
           Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to
           Caesar.

44:025:022 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man
           myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.

44:025:023 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
           great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with
           the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus'
           commandment Paul was brought forth.

44:025:024 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
           present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude
           of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also
           here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.

44:025:025 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of
           death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have
           determined to send him.

44:025:026 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.
           Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially
           before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I
           might have somewhat to write.

44:025:027 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
           withal to signify the crimes laid against him.

44:026:001 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
           thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for
           himself:

44:026:002 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for
           myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I
           am accused of the Jews:

44:026:003 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and
           questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee
           to hear me patiently.

44:026:004 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
           mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;

44:026:005 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that
           after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a
           Pharisee.

44:026:006 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made
           of God, unto our fathers:

44:026:007 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God
           day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king
           Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.

44:026:008 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
           should raise the dead?

44:026:009 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
           contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

44:026:010 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints
           did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the
           chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my
           voice against them.

44:026:011 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
           to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I
           persecuted them even unto strange cities.

44:026:012 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
           from the chief priests,

44:026:013 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above
           the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them
           which journeyed with me.

44:026:014 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
           speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
           why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against
           the pricks.

44:026:015 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
           thou persecutest.

44:026:016 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
           thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
           both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things
           in the which I will appear unto thee;

44:026:017 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto
           whom now I send thee,

44:026:018 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
           and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
           forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are
           sanctified by faith that is in me.

44:026:019 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
           heavenly vision:

44:026:020 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
           throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles,
           that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
           repentance.

44:026:021 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
           about to kill me.

44:026:022 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this
           day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other
           things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should
           come:

44:026:023 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first
           that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the
           people, and to the Gentiles.

44:026:024 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
           voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make
           thee mad.

44:026:025 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
           the words of truth and soberness.

44:026:026 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
           freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are
           hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.

44:026:027 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
           believest.

44:026:028 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
           Christian.

44:026:029 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also
           all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether
           such as I am, except these bonds.

44:026:030 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the
           governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:

44:026:031 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
           saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

44:026:032 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
           liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

44:027:001 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy,
           they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named
           Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.

44:027:002 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning
           to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian
           of Thessalonica, being with us.

44:027:003 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
           entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to
           refresh himself.

44:027:004 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
           because the winds were contrary.

44:027:005 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
           we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.

44:027:006 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing
           into Italy; and he put us therein.

44:027:007 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
           over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed
           under Crete, over against Salmone;

44:027:008 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The
           fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.

44:027:009 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now
           dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul
           admonished them,

44:027:010 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be
           with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship,
           but also of our lives.

44:027:011 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner
           of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

44:027:012 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the
           more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they
           might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an
           haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north
           west.

44:027:013 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
           obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by
           Crete.

44:027:014 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
           called Euroclydon.

44:027:015 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
           wind, we let her drive.

44:027:016 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we
           had much work to come by the boat:

44:027:017 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding
           the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the
           quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.

44:027:018 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
           they lightened the ship;

44:027:019 And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling
           of the ship.

44:027:020 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
           small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was
           then taken away.

44:027:021 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of
           them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and
           not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and
           loss.

44:027:022 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be
           no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.

44:027:023 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
           and whom I serve,

44:027:024 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar:
           and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.

44:027:025 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it
           shall be even as it was told me.

44:027:026 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.

44:027:027 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up
           and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they
           drew near to some country;

44:027:028 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had
           gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it
           fifteen fathoms.

44:027:029 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
           four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

44:027:030 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when
           they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as
           though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,

44:027:031 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these
           abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.

44:027:032 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
           fall off.

44:027:033 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to
           take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have
           tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.

44:027:034 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your
           health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any
           of you.

44:027:035 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to
           God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he
           began to eat.

44:027:036 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some
           meat.

44:027:037 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
           sixteen souls.

44:027:038 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
           cast out the wheat into the sea.

44:027:039 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they
           discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they
           were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.

44:027:040 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
           themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and
           hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.

44:027:041 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
           aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable,
           but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.

44:027:042 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any
           of them should swim out, and escape.

44:027:043 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
           purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast
           themselves first into the sea, and get to land:

44:027:044 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the
           ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to
           land.

44:028:001 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
           called Melita.

44:028:002 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for
           they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the
           present rain, and because of the cold.

44:028:003 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them
           on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened
           on his hand.

44:028:004 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his
           hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a
           murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance
           suffereth not to live.

44:028:005 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.

44:028:006 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen
           down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while,
           and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and
           said that he was a god.

44:028:007 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
           island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us
           three days courteously.

44:028:008 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
           fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and
           prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.

44:028:009 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
           island, came, and were healed:

44:028:010 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed,
           they laded us with such things as were necessary.

44:028:011 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
           which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and
           Pollux.

44:028:012 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.

44:028:013 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
           after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to
           Puteoli:

44:028:014 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them
           seven days: and so we went toward Rome.

44:028:015 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
           meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom
           when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

44:028:016 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the
           prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered
           to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.

44:028:017 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
           chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together,
           he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed
           nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was
           I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the
           Romans.

44:028:018 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
           there was no cause of death in me.

44:028:019 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to
           appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation
           of.

44:028:020 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you,
           and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I
           am bound with this chain.

44:028:021 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
           Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came
           shewed or spake any harm of thee.

44:028:022 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
           concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken
           against.

44:028:023 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
           into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the
           kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of
           the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till
           evening.

44:028:024 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
           believed not.

44:028:025 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed,
           after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost
           by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,

44:028:026 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,
           and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not
           perceive:

44:028:027 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears
           are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest
           they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
           understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I
           should heal them.

44:028:028 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
           sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.

44:028:029 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
           great reasoning among themselves.

44:028:030 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
           received all that came in unto him,

44:028:031 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
           concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man
           forbidding him.

Book 45        Romans

45:001:001 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
           separated unto the gospel of God,

45:001:002 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy
           scriptures,)

45:001:003 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
           the seed of David according to the flesh;

45:001:004 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
           spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

45:001:005 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience
           to the faith among all nations, for his name:

45:001:006 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:

45:001:007 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:
           Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
           Christ.

45:001:008 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
           your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

45:001:009 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
           gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
           always in my prayers;

45:001:010 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
           prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

45:001:011 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
           spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;

45:001:012 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
           mutual faith both of you and me.

45:001:013 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
           purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I
           might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
           Gentiles.

45:001:014 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
           the wise, and to the unwise.

45:001:015 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to
           you that are at Rome also.

45:001:016 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
           power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to
           the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

45:001:017 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
           faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

45:001:018 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
           ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
           unrighteousness;

45:001:019 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them;
           for God hath shewed it unto them.

45:001:020 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
           are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
           made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are
           without excuse:

45:001:021 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as
           God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their
           imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

45:001:022 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

45:001:023 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image
           made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted
           beasts, and creeping things.

45:001:024 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the
           lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies
           between themselves:

45:001:025 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
           served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for
           ever. Amen.

45:001:026 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
           their women did change the natural use into that which is
           against nature:

45:001:027 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the
           woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men
           working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves
           that recompence of their error which was meet.

45:001:028 And even as they did not like to retain God in their
           knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those
           things which are not convenient;

45:001:029 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
           wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder,
           debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

45:001:030 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters,
           inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

45:001:031 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural
           affection, implacable, unmerciful:

45:001:032 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
           things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have
           pleasure in them that do them.

45:002:001 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
           judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
           thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.

45:002:002 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
           against them which commit such things.

45:002:003 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
           things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the
           judgment of God?

45:002:004 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance
           and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God
           leadeth thee to repentance?

45:002:005 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto
           thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the
           righteous judgment of God;

45:002:006 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:

45:002:007 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for
           glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:

45:002:008 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth,
           but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,

45:002:009 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth
           evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;

45:002:010 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good,
           to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:

45:002:011 For there is no respect of persons with God.

45:002:012 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish
           without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
           judged by the law;

45:002:013 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
           doers of the law shall be justified.

45:002:014 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature
           the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,
           are a law unto themselves:

45:002:015 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their
           conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean
           while accusing or else excusing one another;)

45:002:016 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
           Christ according to my gospel.

45:002:017 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and
           makest thy boast of God,

45:002:018 And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more
           excellent, being instructed out of the law;

45:002:019 And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind,
           a light of them which are in darkness,

45:002:020 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast
           the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

45:002:021 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not
           thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou
           steal?

45:002:022 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou
           commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit
           sacrilege?

45:002:023 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the
           law dishonourest thou God?

45:002:024 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through
           you, as it is written.

45:002:025 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but
           if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
           uncircumcision.

45:002:026 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
           law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

45:002:027 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil
           the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost
           transgress the law?

45:002:028 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that
           circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:

45:002:029 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is
           that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose
           praise is not of men, but of God.

45:003:001 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
           circumcision?

45:003:002 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed
           the oracles of God.

45:003:003 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make
           the faith of God without effect?

45:003:004 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it
           is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings,
           and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

45:003:005 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God,
           what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I
           speak as a man)

45:003:006 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

45:003:007 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto
           his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

45:003:008 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some
           affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose
           damnation is just.

45:003:009 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we
           have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all
           under sin;

45:003:010 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

45:003:011 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
           after God.

45:003:012 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
           unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

45:003:013 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they
           have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:

45:003:014 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

45:003:015 Their feet are swift to shed blood:

45:003:016 Destruction and misery are in their ways:

45:003:017 And the way of peace have they not known:

45:003:018 There is no fear of God before their eyes.

45:003:019 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to
           them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped,
           and all the world may become guilty before God.

45:003:020 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
           justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of
           sin.

45:003:021 But now the righteousness of God without the law is
           manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

45:003:022 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
           Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is
           no difference:

45:003:023 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

45:003:024 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
           that is in Christ Jesus:

45:003:025 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
           his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of
           sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

45:003:026 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he
           might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
           Jesus.

45:003:027 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
           Nay: but by the law of faith.

45:003:028 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
           the deeds of the law.

45:003:029 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the
           Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

45:003:030 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by
           faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

45:003:031 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,
           we establish the law.

45:004:001 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining
           to the flesh, hath found?

45:004:002 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to
           glory; but not before God.

45:004:003 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
           counted unto him for righteousness.

45:004:004 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace,
           but of debt.

45:004:005 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
           justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
           righteousness.

45:004:006 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
           whom God imputeth righteousness without works,

45:004:007 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
           whose sins are covered.

45:004:008 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

45:004:009 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or
           upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was
           reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.

45:004:010 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
           uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

45:004:011 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
           righteousness of the faith which he had yet being
           uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that
           believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness
           might be imputed unto them also:

45:004:012 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
           circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that
           faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet
           uncircumcised.

45:004:013 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was
           not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through
           the righteousness of faith.

45:004:014 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
           and the promise made of none effect:

45:004:015 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is
           no transgression.

45:004:016 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
           end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that
           only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the
           faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,

45:004:017 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,)
           before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the
           dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they
           were.

45:004:018 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
           father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So
           shall thy seed be.

45:004:019 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body
           now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet
           the deadness of Sarah's womb:

45:004:020 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but
           was strong in faith, giving glory to God;

45:004:021 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was
           able also to perform.

45:004:022 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

45:004:023 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed
           to him;

45:004:024 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on
           him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;

45:004:025 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for
           our justification.

45:005:001 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
           through our Lord Jesus Christ:

45:005:002 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
           we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

45:005:003 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing
           that tribulation worketh patience;

45:005:004 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:

45:005:005 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
           abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

45:005:006 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
           for the ungodly.

45:005:007 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet
           peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.

45:005:008 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
           yet sinners, Christ died for us.

45:005:009 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
           saved from wrath through him.

45:005:010 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
           death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be
           saved by his life.

45:005:011 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
           Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

45:005:012 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
           by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
           sinned:

45:005:013 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not
           imputed when there is no law.

45:005:014 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
           that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
           transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.

45:005:015 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if
           through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace
           of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus
           Christ, hath abounded unto many.

45:005:016 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
           judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of
           many offences unto justification.

45:005:017 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more
           they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of
           righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)

45:005:018 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men
           to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free
           gift came upon all men unto justification of life.

45:005:019 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
           the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.

45:005:020 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
           where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:

45:005:021 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
           through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our
           Lord.

45:006:001 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace
           may abound?

45:006:002 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any
           longer therein?

45:006:003 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
           Christ were baptized into his death?

45:006:004 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
           like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
           Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

45:006:005 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
           death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

45:006:006 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the
           body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not
           serve sin.

45:006:007 For he that is dead is freed from sin.

45:006:008 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
           live with him:

45:006:009 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;
           death hath no more dominion over him.

45:006:010 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
           liveth, he liveth unto God.

45:006:011 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
           but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

45:006:012 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
           should obey it in the lusts thereof.

45:006:013 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
           unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as
           those that are alive from the dead, and your members as
           instruments of righteousness unto God.

45:006:014 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
           the law, but under grace.

45:006:015 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
           under grace? God forbid.

45:006:016 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
           obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto
           death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

45:006:017 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye
           have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was
           delivered you.

45:006:018 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
           righteousness.

45:006:019 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of
           your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to
           uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield
           your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.

45:006:020 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
           righteousness.

45:006:021 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
           ashamed? for the end of those things is death.

45:006:022 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God,
           ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting
           life.

45:006:023 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
           life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

45:007:001 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the
           law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he
           liveth?

45:007:002 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her
           husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she
           is loosed from the law of her husband.

45:007:003 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to
           another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her
           husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no
           adulteress, though she be married to another man.

45:007:004 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by
           the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even
           to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth
           fruit unto God.

45:007:005 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were
           by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto
           death.

45:007:006 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein
           we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and
           not in the oldness of the letter.

45:007:007 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had
           not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust,
           except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.

45:007:008 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
           manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.

45:007:009 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment
           came, sin revived, and I died.

45:007:010 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
           unto death.

45:007:011 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and
           by it slew me.

45:007:012 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
           and good.

45:007:013 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid.
           But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that
           which is good; that sin by the commandment might become
           exceeding sinful.

45:007:014 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
           under sin.

45:007:015 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I
           not; but what I hate, that do I.

45:007:016 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law
           that it is good.

45:007:017 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
           me.

45:007:018 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
           thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that
           which is good I find not.

45:007:019 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would
           not, that I do.

45:007:020 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but
           sin that dwelleth in me.

45:007:021 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
           with me.

45:007:022 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

45:007:023 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law
           of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin
           which is in my members.

45:007:024 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
           of this death?

45:007:025 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the
           mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law
           of sin.

45:008:001 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
           Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
           Spirit.

45:008:002 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
           free from the law of sin and death.

45:008:003 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
           flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful
           flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

45:008:004 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
           who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

45:008:005 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the
           flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the
           Spirit.

45:008:006 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually
           minded is life and peace.

45:008:007 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
           subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

45:008:008 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

45:008:009 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that
           the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the
           Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

45:008:010 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but
           the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

45:008:011 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead
           dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall
           also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
           you.

45:008:012 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
           after the flesh.

45:008:013 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye
           through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
           live.

45:008:014 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons
           of God.

45:008:015 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
           but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
           Abba, Father.

45:008:016 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
           the children of God:

45:008:017 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs
           with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be
           also glorified together.

45:008:018 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
           worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed
           in us.

45:008:019 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
           manifestation of the sons of God.

45:008:020 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly,
           but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,

45:008:021 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
           bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the
           children of God.

45:008:022 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
           pain together until now.

45:008:023 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the
           firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
           ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
           our body.

45:008:024 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope:
           for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

45:008:025 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
           wait for it.

45:008:026 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
           not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
           maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
           uttered.

45:008:027 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
           the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints
           according to the will of God.

45:008:028 And we know that all things work together for good to them
           that love God, to them who are the called according to his
           purpose.

45:008:029 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
           conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the
           firstborn among many brethren.

45:008:030 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
           whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified,
           them he also glorified.

45:008:031 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who
           can be against us?

45:008:032 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
           all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

45:008:033 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is
           God that justifieth.

45:008:034 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
           that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
           also maketh intercession for us.

45:008:035 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
           tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
           nakedness, or peril, or sword?

45:008:036 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long;
           we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

45:008:037 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through
           him that loved us.

45:008:038 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
           nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
           to come,

45:008:039 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
           to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
           our Lord.

45:009:001 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also
           bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,

45:009:002 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

45:009:003 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
           brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

45:009:004 Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the
           glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the
           service of God, and the promises;

45:009:005 Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh
           Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

45:009:006 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they
           are not all Israel, which are of Israel:

45:009:007 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
           children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.

45:009:008 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are
           not the children of God: but the children of the promise are
           counted for the seed.

45:009:009 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
           Sarah shall have a son.

45:009:010 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
           even by our father Isaac;

45:009:011 (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any
           good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election
           might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)

45:009:012 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.

45:009:013 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

45:009:014 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
           forbid.

45:009:015 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
           mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
           compassion.

45:009:016 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
           runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.

45:009:017 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same
           purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in
           thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the
           earth.

45:009:018 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom
           he will he hardeneth.

45:009:019 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For
           who hath resisted his will?

45:009:020 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall
           the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made
           me thus?

45:009:021 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
           make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

45:009:022 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power
           known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath
           fitted to destruction:

45:009:023 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the
           vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

45:009:024 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also
           of the Gentiles?

45:009:025 As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which
           were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.

45:009:026 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said
           unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called
           the children of the living God.

45:009:027 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the
           children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall
           be saved:

45:009:028 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in
           righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon
           the earth.

45:009:029 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left
           us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto
           Gomorrha.

45:009:030 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not
           after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the
           righteousness which is of faith.

45:009:031 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,
           hath not attained to the law of righteousness.

45:009:032 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were
           by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that
           stumblingstone;

45:009:033 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and
           rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be
           ashamed.

45:010:001 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
           that they might be saved.

45:010:002 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
           according to knowledge.

45:010:003 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going
           about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
           themselves unto the righteousness of God.

45:010:004 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
           one that believeth.

45:010:005 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
           That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.

45:010:006 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
           Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that
           is, to bring Christ down from above:)

45:010:007 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
           Christ again from the dead.)

45:010:008 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth,
           and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;

45:010:009 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
           shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
           dead, thou shalt be saved.

45:010:010 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
           the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

45:010:011 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not
           be ashamed.

45:010:012 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
           the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

45:010:013 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
           saved.

45:010:014 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
           believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have
           not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?

45:010:015 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is
           written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
           gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

45:010:016 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,
           Lord, who hath believed our report?

45:010:017 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
           God.

45:010:018 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
           into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the
           world.

45:010:019 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
           provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a
           foolish nation I will anger you.

45:010:020 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
           sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not
           after me.

45:010:021 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my
           hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

45:011:001 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I
           also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of
           Benjamin.

45:011:002 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye
           not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh
           intercession to God against Israel saying,

45:011:003 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine
           altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

45:011:004 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to
           myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the
           image of Baal.

45:011:005 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
           according to the election of grace.

45:011:006 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace
           is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more
           grace: otherwise work is no more work.

45:011:007 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;
           but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.

45:011:008 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of
           slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they
           should not hear;) unto this day.

45:011:009 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
           and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:

45:011:010 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow
           down their back alway.

45:011:011 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
           forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto
           the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.

45:011:012 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
           diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more
           their fulness?

45:011:013 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of
           the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:

45:011:014 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my
           flesh, and might save some of them.

45:011:015 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the
           world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the
           dead?

45:011:016 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if
           the root be holy, so are the branches.

45:011:017 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
           wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them
           partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;

45:011:018 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou
           bearest not the root, but the root thee.

45:011:019 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might
           be graffed in.

45:011:020 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
           standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:

45:011:021 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he
           also spare not thee.

45:011:022 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them
           which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou
           continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut
           off.

45:011:023 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
           graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.

45:011:024 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
           nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive
           tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural
           branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?

45:011:025 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
           mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that
           blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of
           the Gentiles be come in.

45:011:026 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There
           shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away
           ungodliness from Jacob:

45:011:027 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away
           their sins.

45:011:028 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but
           as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's
           sakes.

45:011:029 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

45:011:030 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
           obtained mercy through their unbelief:

45:011:031 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your
           mercy they also may obtain mercy.

45:011:032 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might
           have mercy upon all.

45:011:033 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
           God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
           finding out!

45:011:034 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his
           counsellor?

45:011:035 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
           unto him again?

45:011:036 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to
           whom be glory for ever. Amen.

45:012:001 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
           ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
           unto God, which is your reasonable service.

45:012:002 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
           the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
           good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

45:012:003 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that
           is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he
           ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath
           dealt to every man the measure of faith.

45:012:004 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
           not the same office:

45:012:005 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one
           members one of another.

45:012:006 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is
           given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to
           the proportion of faith;

45:012:007 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that
           teacheth, on teaching;

45:012:008 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him
           do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that
           sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

45:012:009 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
           cleave to that which is good.

45:012:010 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
           honour preferring one another;

45:012:011 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

45:012:012 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant
           in prayer;

45:012:013 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

45:012:014 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

45:012:015 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that
           weep.

45:012:016 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,
           but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own
           conceits.

45:012:017 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in
           the sight of all men.

45:012:018 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
           with all men.

45:012:019 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
           unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will
           repay, saith the Lord.

45:012:020 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
           him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on
           his head.

45:012:021 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

45:013:001 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is
           no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

45:013:002 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the
           ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to
           themselves damnation.

45:013:003 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
           Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is
           good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:

45:013:004 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do
           that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in
           vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute
           wrath upon him that doeth evil.

45:013:005 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but
           also for conscience sake.

45:013:006 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's
           ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

45:013:007 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is
           due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom
           honour.

45:013:008 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that
           loveth another hath fulfilled the law.

45:013:009 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
           Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou
           shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is
           briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love
           thy neighbour as thyself.

45:013:010 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
           fulfilling of the law.

45:013:011 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
           out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we
           believed.

45:013:012 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
           cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour
           of light.

45:013:013 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
           drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife
           and envying.

45:013:014 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision
           for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

45:014:001 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
           disputations.

45:014:002 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is
           weak, eateth herbs.

45:014:003 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let
           not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath
           received him.

45:014:004 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own
           master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for
           God is able to make him stand.

45:014:005 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth
           every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
           mind.

45:014:006 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he
           that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.
           He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks;
           and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth
           God thanks.

45:014:007 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

45:014:008 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we
           die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die,
           we are the Lord's.

45:014:009 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that
           he might be Lord both of the dead and living.

45:014:010 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
           nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment
           seat of Christ.

45:014:011 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
           bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

45:014:012 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

45:014:013 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge
           this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion
           to fall in his brother's way.

45:014:014 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is
           nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing
           to be unclean, to him it is unclean.

45:014:015 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
           not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ
           died.

45:014:016 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

45:014:017 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
           righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

45:014:018 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to
           God, and approved of men.

45:014:019 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,
           and things wherewith one may edify another.

45:014:020 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
           pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

45:014:021 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
           thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is
           made weak.

45:014:022 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he
           that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

45:014:023 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth
           not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

45:015:001 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
           weak, and not to please ourselves.

45:015:002 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to
           edification.

45:015:003 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written,
           The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

45:015:004 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
           our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
           scriptures might have hope.

45:015:005 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
           likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:

45:015:006 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the
           Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

45:015:007 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us
           to the glory of God.

45:015:008 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
           for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the
           fathers:

45:015:009 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it
           is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the
           Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.

45:015:010 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

45:015:011 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all
           ye people.

45:015:012 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
           he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall
           the Gentiles trust.

45:015:013 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
           believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of
           the Holy Ghost.

45:015:014 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye
           also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able
           also to admonish one another.

45:015:015 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto
           you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace
           that is given to me of God,

45:015:016 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,
           ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the
           Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy
           Ghost.

45:015:017 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
           those things which pertain to God.

45:015:018 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which
           Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient,
           by word and deed,

45:015:019 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit
           of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto
           Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

45:015:020 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ
           was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:

45:015:021 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall
           see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

45:015:022 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
           you.

45:015:023 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a
           great desire these many years to come unto you;

45:015:024 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:
           for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my
           way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with
           your company.

45:015:025 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

45:015:026 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
           certain contribution for the poor saints which are at
           Jerusalem.

45:015:027 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For
           if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual
           things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal
           things.

45:015:028 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them
           this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

45:015:029 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
           fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

45:015:030 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
           and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with
           me in your prayers to God for me;

45:015:031 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in
           Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be
           accepted of the saints;

45:015:032 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may
           with you be refreshed.

45:015:033 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

45:016:001 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the
           church which is at Cenchrea:

45:016:002 That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that
           ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for
           she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.

45:016:003 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:

45:016:004 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not
           only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

45:016:005 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my
           well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto
           Christ.

45:016:006 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.

45:016:007 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my
           fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also
           were in Christ before me.

45:016:008 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

45:016:009 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

45:016:010 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
           Aristobulus' household.

45:016:011 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the
           household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.

45:016:012 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute
           the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.

45:016:013 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

45:016:014 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
           brethren which are with them.

45:016:015 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
           Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.

45:016:016 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ
           salute you.

45:016:017 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions
           and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned;
           and avoid them.

45:016:018 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
           their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive
           the hearts of the simple.

45:016:019 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
           therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto
           that which is good, and simple concerning evil.

45:016:020 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
           shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

45:016:021 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,
           my kinsmen, salute you.

45:016:022 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

45:016:023 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you.
           Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus
           a brother.

45:016:024 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

45:016:025 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my
           gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the
           revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the
           world began,

45:016:026 But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the
           prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God,
           made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:

45:016:027 To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever.
           Amen.

Book 46        1 Corinthians

46:001:001 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
           of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

46:001:002 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are
           sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that
           in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord,
           both their's and our's:

46:001:003 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from
           the Lord Jesus Christ.

46:001:004 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God
           which is given you by Jesus Christ;

46:001:005 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance,
           and in all knowledge;

46:001:006 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:

46:001:007 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of
           our Lord Jesus Christ:

46:001:008 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be
           blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

46:001:009 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of
           his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

46:001:010 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
           Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no
           divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together
           in the same mind and in the same judgment.

46:001:011 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them
           which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions
           among you.

46:001:012 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and
           I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

46:001:013 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
           baptized in the name of Paul?

46:001:014 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and
           Gaius;

46:001:015 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.

46:001:016 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I
           know not whether I baptized any other.

46:001:017 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel:
           not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be
           made of none effect.

46:001:018 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
           foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of
           God.

46:001:019 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
           will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

46:001:020 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer
           of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this
           world?

46:001:021 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew
           not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to
           save them that believe.

46:001:022 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:

46:001:023 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
           stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;

46:001:024 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ
           the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

46:001:025 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
           weakness of God is stronger than men.

46:001:026 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
           after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:

46:001:027 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to
           confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the
           world to confound the things which are mighty;

46:001:028 And base things of the world, and things which are despised,
           hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
           nought things that are:

46:001:029 That no flesh should glory in his presence.

46:001:030 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
           wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

46:001:031 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him
           glory in the Lord.

46:002:001 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
           of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of
           God.

46:002:002 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
           Christ, and him crucified.

46:002:003 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
           trembling.

46:002:004 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of
           man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

46:002:005 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in
           the power of God.

46:002:006 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not
           the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world,
           that come to nought:

46:002:007 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
           wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

46:002:008 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they
           known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

46:002:009 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
           neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which
           God hath prepared for them that love him.

46:002:010 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the
           Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

46:002:011 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of
           man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man,
           but the Spirit of God.

46:002:012 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
           spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are
           freely given to us of God.

46:002:013 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's
           wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing
           spiritual things with spiritual.

46:002:014 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
           God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know
           them, because they are spiritually discerned.

46:002:015 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
           judged of no man.

46:002:016 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
           him? But we have the mind of Christ.

46:003:001 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,
           but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

46:003:002 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye
           were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.

46:003:003 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying,
           and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

46:003:004 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of
           Apollos; are ye not carnal?

46:003:005 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye
           believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?

46:003:006 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

46:003:007 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
           watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

46:003:008 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every
           man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

46:003:009 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's
           husbandry, ye are God's building.

46:003:010 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a
           wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another
           buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth
           thereupon.

46:003:011 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
           is Jesus Christ.

46:003:012 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver,
           precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;

46:003:013 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall
           declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire
           shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

46:003:014 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he
           shall receive a reward.

46:003:015 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but
           he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

46:003:016 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit
           of God dwelleth in you?

46:003:017 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
           for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

46:003:018 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be
           wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be
           wise.

46:003:019 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it
           is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

46:003:020 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that
           they are vain.

46:003:021 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;

46:003:022 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
           death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;

46:003:023 And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

46:004:001 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
           stewards of the mysteries of God.

46:004:002 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found
           faithful.

46:004:003 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged
           of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.

46:004:004 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified:
           but he that judgeth me is the Lord.

46:004:005 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
           who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness,
           and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then
           shall every man have praise of God.

46:004:006 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to
           myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in
           us not to think of men above that which is written, that no
           one of you be puffed up for one against another.

46:004:007 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
           that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why
           dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?

46:004:008 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings
           without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also
           might reign with you.

46:004:009 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as
           it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto
           the world, and to angels, and to men.

46:004:010 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we
           are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are
           despised.

46:004:011 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and
           are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain
           dwellingplace;

46:004:012 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we
           bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:

46:004:013 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the
           world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.

46:004:014 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons
           I warn you.

46:004:015 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet
           have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten
           you through the gospel.

46:004:016 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

46:004:017 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my
           beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you
           into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach
           every where in every church.

46:004:018 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.

46:004:019 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will
           know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the
           power.

46:004:020 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

46:004:021 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love,
           and in the spirit of meekness?

46:005:001 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you,
           and such fornication as is not so much as named among the
           Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.

46:005:002 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he
           that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.

46:005:003 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
           judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that
           hath so done this deed,

46:005:004 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered
           together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus
           Christ,

46:005:005 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the
           flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
           Jesus.

46:005:006 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
           leaveneth the whole lump?

46:005:007 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,
           as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is
           sacrificed for us:

46:005:008 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither
           with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the
           unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

46:005:009 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with
           fornicators:

46:005:010 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with
           the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then
           must ye needs go out of the world.

46:005:011 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any
           man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or
           an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner;
           with such an one no not to eat.

46:005:012 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do
           not ye judge them that are within?

46:005:013 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from
           among yourselves that wicked person.

46:006:001 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law
           before the unjust, and not before the saints?

46:006:002 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if
           the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the
           smallest matters?

46:006:003 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things
           that pertain to this life?

46:006:004 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life,
           set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

46:006:005 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man
           among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his
           brethren?

46:006:006 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the
           unbelievers.

46:006:007 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye
           go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong?
           why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

46:006:008 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.

46:006:009 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom
           of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
           nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
           mankind,

46:006:010 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
           extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

46:006:011 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
           sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord
           Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

46:006:012 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not
           expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be
           brought under the power of any.

46:006:013 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
           destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication,
           but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

46:006:014 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up
           us by his own power.

46:006:015 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall
           I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members
           of an harlot? God forbid.

46:006:016 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
           body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

46:006:017 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

46:006:018 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the
           body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his
           own body.

46:006:019 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
           Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not
           your own?

46:006:020 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
           body, and in your spirit, which are God's.

46:007:001 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good
           for a man not to touch a woman.

46:007:002 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
           wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

46:007:003 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and
           likewise also the wife unto the husband.

46:007:004 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
           likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but
           the wife.

46:007:005 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a
           time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and
           come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your
           incontinency.

46:007:006 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.

46:007:007 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man
           hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and
           another after that.

46:007:008 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for
           them if they abide even as I.

46:007:009 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better
           to marry than to burn.

46:007:010 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let
           not the wife depart from her husband:

46:007:011 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be
           reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away
           his wife.

46:007:012 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a
           wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him,
           let him not put her away.

46:007:013 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if
           he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

46:007:014 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
           unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your
           children unclean; but now are they holy.

46:007:015 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
           sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called
           us to peace.

46:007:016 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
           husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save
           thy wife?

46:007:017 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath
           called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all
           churches.

46:007:018 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become
           uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be
           circumcised.

46:007:019 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but
           the keeping of the commandments of God.

46:007:020 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

46:007:021 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou
           mayest be made free, use it rather.

46:007:022 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the
           Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free,
           is Christ's servant.

46:007:023 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

46:007:024 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide
           with God.

46:007:025 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet
           I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the
           Lord to be faithful.

46:007:026 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present
           distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.

46:007:027 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
           loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.

46:007:028 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
           marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have
           trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.

46:007:029 But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth,
           that both they that have wives be as though they had none;

46:007:030 And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that
           rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as
           though they possessed not;

46:007:031 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the
           fashion of this world passeth away.

46:007:032 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried
           careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may
           please the Lord:

46:007:033 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the
           world, how he may please his wife.

46:007:034 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The
           unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she
           may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is
           married careth for the things of the world, how she may please
           her husband.

46:007:035 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a
           snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may
           attend upon the Lord without distraction.

46:007:036 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward
           his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so
           require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them
           marry.

46:007:037 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no
           necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so
           decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.

46:007:038 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that
           giveth her not in marriage doeth better.

46:007:039 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth;
           but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to
           whom she will; only in the Lord.

46:007:040 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I
           think also that I have the Spirit of God.

46:008:001 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all
           have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

46:008:002 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth
           nothing yet as he ought to know.

46:008:003 But if any man love God, the same is known of him.

46:008:004 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
           offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is
           nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but
           one.

46:008:005 For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or
           in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)

46:008:006 But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all
           things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are
           all things, and we by him.

46:008:007 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some
           with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing
           offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is
           defiled.

46:008:008 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are
           we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.

46:008:009 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become
           a stumblingblock to them that are weak.

46:008:010 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in
           the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is
           weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to
           idols;

46:008:011 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for
           whom Christ died?

46:008:012 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
           conscience, ye sin against Christ.

46:008:013 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no
           flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to
           offend.

46:009:001 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus
           Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?

46:009:002 If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you:
           for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.

46:009:003 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,

46:009:004 Have we not power to eat and to drink?

46:009:005 Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as
           other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

46:009:006 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?

46:009:007 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth
           a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who
           feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

46:009:008 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same
           also?

46:009:009 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle
           the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take
           care for oxen?

46:009:010 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no
           doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in
           hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of
           his hope.

46:009:011 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing
           if we shall reap your carnal things?

46:009:012 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we
           rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer
           all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.

46:009:013 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live
           of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar
           are partakers with the altar?

46:009:014 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the
           gospel should live of the gospel.

46:009:015 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written
           these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were
           better for me to die, than that any man should make my
           glorying void.

46:009:016 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of:
           for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I
           preach not the gospel!

46:009:017 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if
           against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed
           unto me.

46:009:018 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel,
           I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse
           not my power in the gospel.

46:009:019 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself
           servant unto all, that I might gain the more.

46:009:020 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the
           Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I
           might gain them that are under the law;

46:009:021 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not
           without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might
           gain them that are without law.

46:009:022 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am
           made all things to all men, that I might by all means save
           some.

46:009:023 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker
           thereof with you.

46:009:024 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
           receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.

46:009:025 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in
           all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but
           we an incorruptible.

46:009:026 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
           that beateth the air:

46:009:027 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest
           that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself
           should be a castaway.

46:010:001 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
           how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
           through the sea;

46:010:002 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

46:010:003 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;

46:010:004 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of
           that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was
           Christ.

46:010:005 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
           overthrown in the wilderness.

46:010:006 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should
           not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

46:010:007 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is
           written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to
           play.

46:010:008 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed,
           and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

46:010:009 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and
           were destroyed of serpents.

46:010:010 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
           destroyed of the destroyer.

46:010:011 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and
           they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
           world are come.

46:010:012 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
           fall.

46:010:013 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to
           man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
           tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation
           also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.

46:010:014 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

46:010:015 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

46:010:016 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
           the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the
           communion of the body of Christ?

46:010:017 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all
           partakers of that one bread.

46:010:018 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
           sacrifices partakers of the altar?

46:010:019 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is
           offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?

46:010:020 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they
           sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye
           should have fellowship with devils.

46:010:021 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye
           cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of
           devils.

46:010:022 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

46:010:023 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not
           expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify
           not.

46:010:024 Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.

46:010:025 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no
           question for conscience sake:

46:010:026 For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.

46:010:027 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
           disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no
           question for conscience sake.

46:010:028 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
           idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience
           sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:

46:010:029 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is
           my liberty judged of another man's conscience?

46:010:030 For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for
           that for which I give thanks?

46:010:031 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
           all to the glory of God.

46:010:032 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles,
           nor to the church of God:

46:010:033 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own
           profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

46:011:001 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

46:011:002 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
           and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.

46:011:003 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is
           Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of
           Christ is God.

46:011:004 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
           dishonoureth his head.

46:011:005 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
           uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as
           if she were shaven.

46:011:006 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if
           it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be
           covered.

46:011:007 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he
           is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of
           the man.

46:011:008 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.

46:011:009 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for
           the man.

46:011:010 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head
           because of the angels.

46:011:011 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the
           woman without the man, in the Lord.

46:011:012 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
           woman; but all things of God.

46:011:013 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
           uncovered?

46:011:014 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have
           long hair, it is a shame unto him?

46:011:015 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her
           hair is given her for a covering.

46:011:016 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
           neither the churches of God.

46:011:017 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye
           come together not for the better, but for the worse.

46:011:018 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear
           that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.

46:011:019 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
           approved may be made manifest among you.

46:011:020 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to
           eat the Lord's supper.

46:011:021 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper:
           and one is hungry, and another is drunken.

46:011:022 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye
           the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I
           say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.

46:011:023 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
           unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
           betrayed took bread:

46:011:024 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take,
           eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in
           remembrance of me.

46:011:025 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had
           supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood:
           this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.

46:011:026 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
           shew the Lord's death till he come.

46:011:027 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup
           of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood
           of the Lord.

46:011:028 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
           bread, and drink of that cup.

46:011:029 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
           drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

46:011:030 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
           sleep.

46:011:031 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

46:011:032 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
           should not be condemned with the world.

46:011:033 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry
           one for another.

46:011:034 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
           together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order
           when I come.

46:012:001 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
           ignorant.

46:012:002 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
           idols, even as ye were led.

46:012:003 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by
           the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can
           say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

46:012:004 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

46:012:005 And there are differences of administrations, but the same
           Lord.

46:012:006 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same
           God which worketh all in all.

46:012:007 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
           profit withal.

46:012:008 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
           another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

46:012:009 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
           healing by the same Spirit;

46:012:010 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
           another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of
           tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

46:012:011 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
           dividing to every man severally as he will.

46:012:012 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
           members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is
           Christ.

46:012:013 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
           we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
           been all made to drink into one Spirit.

46:012:014 For the body is not one member, but many.

46:012:015 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
           the body; is it therefore not of the body?

46:012:016 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not
           of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

46:012:017 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the
           whole were hearing, where were the smelling?

46:012:018 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the
           body, as it hath pleased him.

46:012:019 And if they were all one member, where were the body?

46:012:020 But now are they many members, yet but one body.

46:012:021 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
           nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

46:012:022 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be
           more feeble, are necessary:

46:012:023 And those members of the body, which we think to be less
           honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our
           uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.

46:012:024 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
           body together, having given more abundant honour to that part
           which lacked.

46:012:025 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the
           members should have the same care one for another.

46:012:026 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
           or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

46:012:027 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

46:012:028 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles,
           secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles,
           then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of
           tongues.

46:012:029 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
           workers of miracles?

46:012:030 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do
           all interpret?

46:012:031 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a
           more excellent way.

46:013:001 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
           not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling
           cymbal.

46:013:002 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
           mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
           that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
           nothing.

46:013:003 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though
           I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
           profiteth me nothing.

46:013:004 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not;
           charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

46:013:005 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
           easily provoked, thinketh no evil;

46:013:006 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

46:013:007 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
           endureth all things.

46:013:008 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
           shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease;
           whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

46:013:009 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

46:013:010 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
           part shall be done away.

46:013:011 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a
           child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put
           away childish things.

46:013:012 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
           now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am
           known.

46:013:013 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
           greatest of these is charity.

46:014:001 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather
           that ye may prophesy.

46:014:002 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto
           men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in
           the spirit he speaketh mysteries.

46:014:003 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
           exhortation, and comfort.

46:014:004 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he
           that prophesieth edifieth the church.

46:014:005 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye
           prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that
           speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church
           may receive edifying.

46:014:006 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
           shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by
           revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by
           doctrine?

46:014:007 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or
           harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall
           it be known what is piped or harped?

46:014:008 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
           himself to the battle?

46:014:009 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be
           understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall
           speak into the air.

46:014:010 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world,
           and none of them is without signification.

46:014:011 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
           unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall
           be a barbarian unto me.

46:014:012 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts,
           seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

46:014:013 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
           he may interpret.

46:014:014 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
           understanding is unfruitful.

46:014:015 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
           with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and
           I will sing with the understanding also.

46:014:016 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
           occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of
           thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?

46:014:017 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not
           edified.

46:014:018 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:

46:014:019 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my
           understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also,
           than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.

46:014:020 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice
           be ye children, but in understanding be men.

46:014:021 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other
           lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will
           they not hear me, saith the Lord.

46:014:022 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe,
           but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for
           them that believe not, but for them which believe.

46:014:023 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
           and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are
           unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?

46:014:024 But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not,
           or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:

46:014:025 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so
           falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that
           God is in you of a truth.

46:014:026 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of
           you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a
           revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done
           unto edifying.

46:014:027 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
           the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.

46:014:028 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
           church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

46:014:029 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

46:014:030 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
           first hold his peace.

46:014:031 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and
           all may be comforted.

46:014:032 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

46:014:033 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in
           all churches of the saints.

46:014:034 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
           permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be
           under obedience as also saith the law.

46:014:035 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands
           at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

46:014:036 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
           only?

46:014:037 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let
           him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the
           commandments of the Lord.

46:014:038 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

46:014:039 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to
           speak with tongues.

46:014:040 Let all things be done decently and in order.

46:015:001 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I
           preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye
           stand;

46:015:002 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I
           preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

46:015:003 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
           received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
           scriptures;

46:015:004 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
           according to the scriptures:

46:015:005 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:

46:015:006 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at
           once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but
           some are fallen asleep.

46:015:007 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

46:015:008 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of
           due time.

46:015:009 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be
           called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

46:015:010 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which
           was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more
           abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God
           which was with me.

46:015:011 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
           believed.

46:015:012 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
           some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

46:015:013 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ
           not risen:

46:015:014 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
           your faith is also vain.

46:015:015 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
           testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not
           up, if so be that the dead rise not.

46:015:016 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:

46:015:017 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in
           your sins.

46:015:018 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

46:015:019 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
           most miserable.

46:015:020 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
           firstfruits of them that slept.

46:015:021 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
           of the dead.

46:015:022 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
           alive.

46:015:023 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
           afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.

46:015:024 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the
           kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down
           all rule and all authority and power.

46:015:025 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
           feet.

46:015:026 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

46:015:027 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith
           all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is
           excepted, which did put all things under him.

46:015:028 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the
           Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under
           him, that God may be all in all.

46:015:029 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if
           the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the
           dead?

46:015:030 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?

46:015:031 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our
           Lord, I die daily.

46:015:032 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at
           Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us
           eat and drink; for to morrow we die.

46:015:033 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

46:015:034 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
           knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.

46:015:035 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with
           what body do they come?

46:015:036 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it
           die:

46:015:037 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that
           shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some
           other grain:

46:015:038 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every
           seed his own body.

46:015:039 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of
           flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and
           another of birds.

46:015:040 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but
           the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the
           terrestrial is another.

46:015:041 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
           and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from
           another star in glory.

46:015:042 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
           corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

46:015:043 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in
           weakness; it is raised in power:

46:015:044 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
           There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

46:015:045 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living
           soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

46:015:046 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which
           is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

46:015:047 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the
           Lord from heaven.

46:015:048 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as
           is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

46:015:049 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also
           bear the image of the heavenly.

46:015:050 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
           the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit
           incorruption.

46:015:051 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
           shall all be changed,

46:015:052 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:
           for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
           incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

46:015:053 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
           must put on immortality.

46:015:054 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
           this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be
           brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed
           up in victory.

46:015:055 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

46:015:056 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

46:015:057 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
           Lord Jesus Christ.

46:015:058 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
           always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know
           that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

46:016:001 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given
           order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.

46:016:002 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him
           in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no
           gatherings when I come.

46:016:003 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters,
           them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.

46:016:004 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.

46:016:005 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia:
           for I do pass through Macedonia.

46:016:006 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you,
           that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.

46:016:007 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a
           while with you, if the Lord permit.

46:016:008 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

46:016:009 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there
           are many adversaries.

46:016:010 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without
           fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.

46:016:011 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in
           peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the
           brethren.

46:016:012 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come
           unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to
           come at this time; but he will come when he shall have
           convenient time.

46:016:013 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be
           strong.

46:016:014 Let all your things be done with charity.

46:016:015 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that
           it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted
           themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

46:016:016 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that
           helpeth with us, and laboureth.

46:016:017 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
           Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have
           supplied.

46:016:018 For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore
           acknowledge ye them that are such.

46:016:019 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute
           you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

46:016:020 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy
           kiss.

46:016:021 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.

46:016:022 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
           Maranatha.

46:016:023 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

46:016:024 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

Book 47        2 Corinthians

47:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
           Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at
           Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:

47:001:002 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the
           Lord Jesus Christ.

47:001:003 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
           Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;

47:001:004 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able
           to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort
           wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

47:001:005 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
           consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

47:001:006 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
           salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same
           sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted,
           it is for your consolation and salvation.

47:001:007 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are
           partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the
           consolation.

47:001:008 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble
           which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure,
           above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:

47:001:009 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should
           not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:

47:001:010 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in
           whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;

47:001:011 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
           bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be
           given by many on our behalf.

47:001:012 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience,
           that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
           wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation
           in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.

47:001:013 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
           acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;

47:001:014 As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your
           rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord
           Jesus.

47:001:015 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before,
           that ye might have a second benefit;

47:001:016 And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of
           Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward
           Judaea.

47:001:017 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the
           things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,
           that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?

47:001:018 But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.

47:001:019 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you
           by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and
           nay, but in him was yea.

47:001:020 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen,
           unto the glory of God by us.

47:001:021 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath
           anointed us, is God;

47:001:022 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit
           in our hearts.

47:001:023 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare
           you I came not as yet unto Corinth.

47:001:024 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers
           of your joy: for by faith ye stand.

47:002:001 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again
           to you in heaviness.

47:002:002 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad,
           but the same which is made sorry by me?

47:002:003 And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should
           have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having
           confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.

47:002:004 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto
           you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that
           ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.

47:002:005 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in
           part: that I may not overcharge you all.

47:002:006 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was
           inflicted of many.

47:002:007 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and
           comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up
           with overmuch sorrow.

47:002:008 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
           him.

47:002:009 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof
           of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.

47:002:010 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave
           any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it
           in the person of Christ;

47:002:011 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not
           ignorant of his devices.

47:002:012 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel,
           and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,

47:002:013 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my
           brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into
           Macedonia.

47:002:014 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
           Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us
           in every place.

47:002:015 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
           saved, and in them that perish:

47:002:016 To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the
           other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for
           these things?

47:002:017 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as
           of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in
           Christ.

47:003:001 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
           others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of
           commendation from you?

47:003:002 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of
           all men:

47:003:003 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of
           Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
           Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in
           fleshy tables of the heart.

47:003:004 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:

47:003:005 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as
           of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

47:003:006 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not
           of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but
           the spirit giveth life.

47:003:007 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in
           stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not
           stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his
           countenance; which glory was to be done away:

47:003:008 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather
           glorious?

47:003:009 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more
           doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

47:003:010 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
           respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.

47:003:011 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that
           which remaineth is glorious.

47:003:012 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
           speech:

47:003:013 And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the
           children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of
           that which is abolished:

47:003:014 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the
           same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament;
           which vail is done away in Christ.

47:003:015 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
           their heart.

47:003:016 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
           taken away.

47:003:017 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord
           is, there is liberty.

47:003:018 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
           of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to
           glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

47:004:001 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
           mercy, we faint not;

47:004:002 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not
           walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God
           deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending
           ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.

47:004:003 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

47:004:004 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them
           which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of
           Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

47:004:005 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
           ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

47:004:006 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
           hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
           of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

47:004:007 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
           excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.

47:004:008 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
           perplexed, but not in despair;

47:004:009 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;

47:004:010 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
           that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our
           body.

47:004:011 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus'
           sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in
           our mortal flesh.

47:004:012 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

47:004:013 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is
           written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also
           believe, and therefore speak;

47:004:014 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up
           us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

47:004:015 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace
           might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of
           God.

47:004:016 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man
           perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

47:004:017 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
           for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

47:004:018 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
           things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are
           temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.

47:005:001 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
           dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with
           hands, eternal in the heavens.

47:005:002 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
           with our house which is from heaven:

47:005:003 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.

47:005:004 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened:
           not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that
           mortality might be swallowed up of life.

47:005:005 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who
           also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

47:005:006 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are
           at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

47:005:007 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

47:005:008 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from
           the body, and to be present with the Lord.

47:005:009 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may
           be accepted of him.

47:005:010 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
           that every one may receive the things done in his body,
           according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

47:005:011 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but
           we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made
           manifest in your consciences.

47:005:012 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you
           occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to
           answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.

47:005:013 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether
           we be sober, it is for your cause.

47:005:014 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
           that if one died for all, then were all dead:

47:005:015 And that he died for all, that they which live should not
           henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
           them, and rose again.

47:005:016 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea,
           though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now
           henceforth know we him no more.

47:005:017 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old
           things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

47:005:018 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself
           by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
           reconciliation;

47:005:019 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
           himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
           committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

47:005:020 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
           beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye
           reconciled to God.

47:005:021 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that
           we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

47:006:001 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that
           ye receive not the grace of God in vain.

47:006:002 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in
           the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the
           accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)

47:006:003 Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not
           blamed:

47:006:004 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God,
           in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in
           distresses,

47:006:005 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in
           watchings, in fastings;

47:006:006 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by
           the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,

47:006:007 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of
           righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

47:006:008 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
           deceivers, and yet true;

47:006:009 As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we
           live; as chastened, and not killed;

47:006:010 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many
           rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.

47:006:011 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is
           enlarged.

47:006:012 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
           bowels.

47:006:013 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my
           children,) be ye also enlarged.

47:006:014 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
           fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what
           communion hath light with darkness?

47:006:015 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he
           that believeth with an infidel?

47:006:016 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye
           are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will
           dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and
           they shall be my people.

47:006:017 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith
           the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive
           you.

47:006:018 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
           daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

47:007:001 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us
           cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
           perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

47:007:002 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man,
           we have defrauded no man.

47:007:003 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that
           ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.

47:007:004 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my
           glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding
           joyful in all our tribulation.

47:007:005 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest,
           but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings,
           within were fears.

47:007:006 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
           comforted us by the coming of Titus;

47:007:007 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith
           he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire,
           your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced
           the more.

47:007:008 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent,
           though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath
           made you sorry, though it were but for a season.

47:007:009 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye
           sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly
           manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.

47:007:010 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
           repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

47:007:011 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
           sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing
           of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea,
           what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In
           all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this
           matter.

47:007:012 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
           that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered
           wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might
           appear unto you.

47:007:013 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and
           exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because
           his spirit was refreshed by you all.

47:007:014 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not
           ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so
           our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.

47:007:015 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst
           he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and
           trembling ye received him.

47:007:016 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all
           things.

47:008:001 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God
           bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;

47:008:002 How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their
           joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their
           liberality.

47:008:003 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power
           they were willing of themselves;

47:008:004 Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift,
           and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the
           saints.

47:008:005 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own
           selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

47:008:006 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he
           would also finish in you the same grace also.

47:008:007 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and
           utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your
           love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.

47:008:008 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness
           of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

47:008:009 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
           he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye
           through his poverty might be rich.

47:008:010 And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you,
           who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward
           a year ago.

47:008:011 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
           readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of
           that which ye have.

47:008:012 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according
           to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.

47:008:013 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:

47:008:014 But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may
           be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a
           supply for your want: that there may be equality:

47:008:015 As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over;
           and he that had gathered little had no lack.

47:008:016 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the
           heart of Titus for you.

47:008:017 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more
           forward, of his own accord he went unto you.

47:008:018 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the
           gospel throughout all the churches;

47:008:019 And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to
           travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to
           the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready
           mind:

47:008:020 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance
           which is administered by us:

47:008:021 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the
           Lord, but also in the sight of men.

47:008:022 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have
           oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more
           diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.

47:008:023 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
           fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of,
           they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of
           Christ.

47:008:024 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof
           of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

47:009:001 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is
           superfluous for me to write to you:

47:009:002 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of
           you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago;
           and your zeal hath provoked very many.

47:009:003 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should
           be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:

47:009:004 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you
           unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this
           same confident boasting.

47:009:005 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that
           they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your
           bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be
           ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.

47:009:006 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also
           sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
           bountifully.

47:009:007 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him
           give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a
           cheerful giver.

47:009:008 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
           always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to
           every good work:

47:009:009 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to
           the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.

47:009:010 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread
           for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the
           fruits of your righteousness;)

47:009:011 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which
           causeth through us thanksgiving to God.

47:009:012 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the
           want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings
           unto God;

47:009:013 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God
           for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and
           for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;

47:009:014 And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the
           exceeding grace of God in you.

47:009:015 Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.

47:010:001 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness
           of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent
           am bold toward you:

47:010:002 But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present
           with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against
           some, which think of us as if we walked according to the
           flesh.

47:010:003 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the
           flesh:

47:010:004 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
           through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)

47:010:005 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth
           itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into
           captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;

47:010:006 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when
           your obedience is fulfilled.

47:010:007 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man
           trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think
           this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.

47:010:008 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority,
           which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your
           destruction, I should not be ashamed:

47:010:009 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.

47:010:010 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his
           bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

47:010:011 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by
           letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when
           we are present.

47:010:012 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare
           ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they
           measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves
           among themselves, are not wise.

47:010:013 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but
           according to the measure of the rule which God hath
           distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.

47:010:014 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
           reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in
           preaching the gospel of Christ:

47:010:015 Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other
           men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased,
           that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule
           abundantly,

47:010:016 To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to
           boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.

47:010:017 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

47:010:018 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
           Lord commendeth.

47:011:001 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and
           indeed bear with me.

47:011:002 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have
           espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a
           chaste virgin to Christ.

47:011:003 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
           through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from
           the simplicity that is in Christ.

47:011:004 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have
           not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have
           not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted,
           ye might well bear with him.

47:011:005 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest
           apostles.

47:011:006 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we
           have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.

47:011:007 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
           exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God
           freely?

47:011:008 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you
           service.

47:011:009 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable
           to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which
           came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept
           myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep
           myself.

47:011:010 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
           boasting in the regions of Achaia.

47:011:011 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.

47:011:012 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion
           from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they
           may be found even as we.

47:011:013 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
           themselves into the apostles of Christ.

47:011:014 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel
           of light.

47:011:015 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be
           transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall
           be according to their works.

47:011:016 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as
           a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

47:011:017 That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it
           were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

47:011:018 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

47:011:019 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

47:011:020 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man
           devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a
           man smite you on the face.

47:011:021 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
           Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am
           bold also.

47:011:022 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are
           they the seed of Abraham? so am I.

47:011:023 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more;
           in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons
           more frequent, in deaths oft.

47:011:024 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

47:011:025 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I
           suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;

47:011:026 In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of
           robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the
           heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness,
           in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;

47:011:027 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger
           and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

47:011:028 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon
           me daily, the care of all the churches.

47:011:029 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn
           not?

47:011:030 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which
           concern mine infirmities.

47:011:031 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
           for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

47:011:032 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city
           of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:

47:011:033 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall,
           and escaped his hands.

47:012:001 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to
           visions and revelations of the Lord.

47:012:002 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in
           the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot
           tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.

47:012:003 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the
           body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)

47:012:004 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
           words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

47:012:005 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory,
           but in mine infirmities.

47:012:006 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for
           I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should
           think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he
           heareth of me.

47:012:007 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the
           abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in
           the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should
           be exalted above measure.

47:012:008 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might
           depart from me.

47:012:009 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
           strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore
           will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of
           Christ may rest upon me.

47:012:010 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
           necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake:
           for when I am weak, then am I strong.

47:012:011 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I
           ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I
           behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.

47:012:012 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
           patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

47:012:013 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,
           except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive
           me this wrong.

47:012:014 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will
           not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for
           the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the
           parents for the children.

47:012:015 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the
           more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

47:012:016 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being
           crafty, I caught you with guile.

47:012:017 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?

47:012:018 I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make
           a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not
           in the same steps?

47:012:019 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak
           before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved,
           for your edifying.

47:012:020 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I
           would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would
           not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes,
           backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:

47:012:021 And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you,
           and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and
           have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and
           lasciviousness which they have committed.

47:013:001 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two
           or three witnesses shall every word be established.

47:013:002 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the
           second time; and being absent now I write to them which
           heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come
           again, I will not spare:

47:013:003 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to
           you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.

47:013:004 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by
           the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall
           live with him by the power of God toward you.

47:013:005 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
           selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is
           in you, except ye be reprobates?

47:013:006 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.

47:013:007 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should
           appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest,
           though we be as reprobates.

47:013:008 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.

47:013:009 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this
           also we wish, even your perfection.

47:013:010 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being
           present I should use sharpness, according to the power which
           the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.

47:013:011 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort,
           be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace
           shall be with you.

47:013:012 Greet one another with an holy kiss.

47:013:013 All the saints salute you.

47:013:014 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
           the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

Book 48        Galatians

48:001:001 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
           Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)

48:001:002 And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of
           Galatia:

48:001:003 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our
           Lord Jesus Christ,

48:001:004 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
           this present evil world, according to the will of God and our
           Father:

48:001:005 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

48:001:006 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you
           into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:

48:001:007 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and
           would pervert the gospel of Christ.

48:001:008 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
           gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let
           him be accursed.

48:001:009 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any
           other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be
           accursed.

48:001:010 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
           for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
           Christ.

48:001:011 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was
           preached of me is not after man.

48:001:012 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but
           by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

48:001:013 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
           religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of
           God, and wasted it:

48:001:014 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in
           mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
           traditions of my fathers.

48:001:015 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's
           womb, and called me by his grace,

48:001:016 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
           heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:

48:001:017 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
           before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto
           Damascus.

48:001:018 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
           and abode with him fifteen days.

48:001:019 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's
           brother.

48:001:020 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I
           lie not.

48:001:021 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;

48:001:022 And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were
           in Christ:

48:001:023 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
           past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.

48:001:024 And they glorified God in me.

48:002:001 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
           Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

48:002:002 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
           gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to
           them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run,
           or had run, in vain.

48:002:003 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
           compelled to be circumcised:

48:002:004 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who
           came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ
           Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:

48:002:005 To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that
           the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

48:002:006 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were,
           it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for
           they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to
           me:

48:002:007 But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
           uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the
           circumcision was unto Peter;

48:002:008 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship
           of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the
           Gentiles:)

48:002:009 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars,
           perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me
           and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go
           unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.

48:002:010 Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same
           which I also was forward to do.

48:002:011 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
           face, because he was to be blamed.

48:002:012 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
           Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated
           himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.

48:002:013 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
           Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.

48:002:014 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
           truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If
           thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and
           not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live
           as do the Jews?

48:002:015 We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,

48:002:016 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
           but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in
           Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
           Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of
           the law shall no flesh be justified.

48:002:017 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves
           also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of
           sin? God forbid.

48:002:018 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make
           myself a transgressor.

48:002:019 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live
           unto God.

48:002:020 I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but
           Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the
           flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and
           gave himself for me.

48:002:021 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come
           by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

48:003:001 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should
           not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
           evidently set forth, crucified among you?

48:003:002 This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the
           works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

48:003:003 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made
           perfect by the flesh?

48:003:004 Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.

48:003:005 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
           miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by
           the hearing of faith?

48:003:006 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
           righteousness.

48:003:007 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are
           the children of Abraham.

48:003:008 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
           heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto
           Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.

48:003:009 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful
           Abraham.

48:003:010 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
           curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth
           not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
           do them.

48:003:011 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,
           it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.

48:003:012 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them
           shall live in them.

48:003:013 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
           a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that
           hangeth on a tree:

48:003:014 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
           through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the
           Spirit through faith.

48:003:015 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a
           man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth,
           or addeth thereto.

48:003:016 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith
           not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,
           which is Christ.

48:003:017 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before
           of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
           years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise
           of none effect.

48:003:018 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of
           promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

48:003:019 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
           transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise
           was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a
           mediator.

48:003:020 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

48:003:021 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for
           if there had been a law given which could have given life,
           verily righteousness should have been by the law.

48:003:022 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the
           promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that
           believe.

48:003:023 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up
           unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

48:003:024 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
           Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

48:003:025 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
           schoolmaster.

48:003:026 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

48:003:027 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
           on Christ.

48:003:028 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor
           free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in
           Christ Jesus.

48:003:029 And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
           according to the promise.

48:004:001 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
           nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

48:004:002 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of
           the father.

48:004:003 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
           elements of the world:

48:004:004 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
           Son, made of a woman, made under the law,

48:004:005 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
           the adoption of sons.

48:004:006 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his
           Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

48:004:007 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
           then an heir of God through Christ.

48:004:008 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them
           which by nature are no gods.

48:004:009 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of
           God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements,
           whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?

48:004:010 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

48:004:011 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in
           vain.

48:004:012 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye
           have not injured me at all.

48:004:013 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the
           gospel unto you at the first.

48:004:014 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
           rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ
           Jesus.

48:004:015 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you
           record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked
           out your own eyes, and have given them to me.

48:004:016 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the
           truth?

48:004:017 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would
           exclude you, that ye might affect them.

48:004:018 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good
           thing, and not only when I am present with you.

48:004:019 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until
           Christ be formed in you,

48:004:020 I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice;
           for I stand in doubt of you.

48:004:021 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear
           the law?

48:004:022 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
           bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

48:004:023 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but
           he of the freewoman was by promise.

48:004:024 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
           the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,
           which is Agar.

48:004:025 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
           Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

48:004:026 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of
           us all.

48:004:027 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
           break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the
           desolate hath many more children than she which hath an
           husband.

48:004:028 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

48:004:029 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
           that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

48:004:030 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman
           and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir
           with the son of the freewoman.

48:004:031 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
           of the free.

48:005:001 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made
           us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

48:005:002 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
           shall profit you nothing.

48:005:003 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he
           is a debtor to do the whole law.

48:005:004 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
           justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

48:005:005 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
           by faith.

48:005:006 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing,
           nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

48:005:007 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
           the truth?

48:005:008 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

48:005:009 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

48:005:010 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be
           none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear
           his judgment, whosoever he be.

48:005:011 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
           suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

48:005:012 I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

48:005:013 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
           liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one
           another.

48:005:014 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
           shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

48:005:015 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be
           not consumed one of another.

48:005:016 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil
           the lust of the flesh.

48:005:017 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
           against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the
