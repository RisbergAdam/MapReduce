05:029:024 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus
           unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?

05:029:025 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of
           the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he
           brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:

05:029:026 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods
           whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

05:029:027 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to
           bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

05:029:028 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
           wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another
           land, as it is this day.

05:029:029 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those
           things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children
           for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

05:030:001 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
           thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before
           thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations,
           whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,

05:030:002 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his
           voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and
           thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

05:030:003 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have
           compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all
           the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

05:030:004 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of
           heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and
           from thence will he fetch thee:

05:030:005 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy
           fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do
           thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.

05:030:006 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
           heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine
           heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

05:030:007 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
           enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

05:030:008 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do
           all his commandments which I command thee this day.

05:030:009 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
           thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy
           cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD
           will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy
           fathers:

05:030:010 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to
           keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in
           this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God
           with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

05:030:011 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not
           hidden from thee, neither is it far off.

05:030:012 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
           for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it,
           and do it?

05:030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
           shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we
           may hear it, and do it?

05:030:014 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
           heart, that thou mayest do it.

05:030:015 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
           and evil;

05:030:016 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to
           walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
           statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and
           multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land
           whither thou goest to possess it.

05:030:017 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
           shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

05:030:018 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and
           that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither
           thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

05:030:019 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
           have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing:
           therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

05:030:020 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest
           obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he
           is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest
           dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to
           Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

05:031:001 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

05:031:002 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old
           this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath
           said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

05:031:003 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
           destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess
           them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD
           hath said.

05:031:004 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
           kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he
           destroyed.

05:031:005 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may
           do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have
           commanded you.

05:031:006 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
           them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee;
           he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

05:031:007 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight
           of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must
           go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn
           unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to
           inherit it.

05:031:008 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be
           with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear
           not, neither be dismayed.

05:031:009 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests
           the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

05:031:010 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
           years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast
           of tabernacles,

05:031:011 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in
           the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law
           before all Israel in their hearing.

05:031:012 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and
           thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and
           that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe
           to do all the words of this law:

05:031:013 And that their children, which have not known any thing, may
           hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live
           in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

05:031:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
           thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the
           tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge.
           And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the
           tabernacle of the congregation.

05:031:015 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a
           cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the
           tabernacle.

05:031:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with
           thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring
           after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go
           to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant
           which I have made with them.

05:031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
           will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they
           shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall
           them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils
           come upon us, because our God is not among us?

05:031:018 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils
           which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto
           other gods.

05:031:019 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
           children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may
           be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

05:031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
           unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they
           shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then
           will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke
           me, and break my covenant.

05:031:021 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
           befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a
           witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of
           their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about,
           even now, before I have brought them into the land which I
           sware.

05:031:022 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it
           the children of Israel.

05:031:023 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be
           strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the
           children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and
           I will be with thee.

05:031:024 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
           words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

05:031:025 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
           covenant of the LORD, saying,

05:031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark
           of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for
           a witness against thee.

05:031:027 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I
           am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious
           against the LORD; and how much more after my death?

05:031:028 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your
           officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call
           heaven and earth to record against them.

05:031:029 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
           yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded
           you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye
           will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
           through the work of your hands.

05:031:030 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
           the words of this song, until they were ended.

05:032:001 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,
           the words of my mouth.

05:032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as
           the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the
           showers upon the grass:

05:032:003 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye
           greatness unto our God.

05:032:004 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are
           judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right
           is he.

05:032:005 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of
           his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

05:032:006 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is
           not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made
           thee, and established thee?

05:032:007 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many
           generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy
           elders, and they will tell thee.

05:032:008 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
           when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the
           people according to the number of the children of Israel.

05:032:009 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
           inheritance.

05:032:010 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
           wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him
           as the apple of his eye.

05:032:011 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
           spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her
           wings:

05:032:012 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
           with him.

05:032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he
           might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck
           honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

05:032:014 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams
           of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of
           wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

05:032:015 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou
           art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he
           forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of
           his salvation.

05:032:016 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
           abominations provoked they him to anger.

05:032:017 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they
           knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers
           feared not.

05:032:018 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
           forgotten God that formed thee.

05:032:019 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
           provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

05:032:020 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
           their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation,
           children in whom is no faith.

05:032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;
           they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will
           move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I
           will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

05:032:022 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
           lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase,
           and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

05:032:023 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
           them.

05:032:024 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning
           heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth
           of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

05:032:025 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
           young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of
           gray hairs.

05:032:026 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
           remembrance of them to cease from among men:

05:032:027 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
           adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they
           should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all
           this.

05:032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
           understanding in them.

05:032:029 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
           would consider their latter end!

05:032:030 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
           flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut
           them up?

05:032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
           being judges.

05:032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
           Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are
           bitter:

05:032:033 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
           asps.

05:032:034 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
           treasures?

05:032:035 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall
           slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand,
           and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

05:032:036 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for
           his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and
           there is none shut up, or left.

05:032:037 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom
           they trusted,

05:032:038 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
           of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and
           be your protection.

05:032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
           kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there
           any that can deliver out of my hand.

05:032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

05:032:041 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
           judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will
           reward them that hate me.

05:032:042 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
           devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
           captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

05:032:043 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the
           blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his
           adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his
           people.

05:032:044 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the
           ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

05:032:045 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all
           Israel:

05:032:046 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words
           which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command
           your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.

05:032:047 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life:
           and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land,
           whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

05:032:048 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

05:032:049 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which
           is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and
           behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of
           Israel for a possession:

05:032:050 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered
           unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and
           was gathered unto his people:

05:032:051 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel
           at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin;
           because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
           Israel.

05:032:052 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
           thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

05:033:001 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God
           blessed the children of Israel before his death.

05:033:002 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir
           unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with
           ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law
           for them.

05:033:003 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and
           they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy
           words.

05:033:004 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the
           congregation of Jacob.

05:033:005 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and
           the tribes of Israel were gathered together.

05:033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

05:033:007 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD,
           the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his
           hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from
           his enemies.

05:033:008 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
           holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou
           didst strive at the waters of Meribah;

05:033:009 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen
           him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own
           children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy
           covenant.

05:033:010 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they
           shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon
           thine altar.

05:033:011 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;
           smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of
           them that hate him, that they rise not again.

05:033:012 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell
           in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day
           long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.

05:033:013 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for
           the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep
           that coucheth beneath,

05:033:014 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for
           the precious things put forth by the moon,

05:033:015 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the
           precious things of the lasting hills,

05:033:016 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof,
           and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the
           blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the
           head of him that was separated from his brethren.

05:033:017 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
           are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the
           people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten
           thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

05:033:018 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
           and, Issachar, in thy tents.

05:033:019 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
           offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the
           abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

05:033:020 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he
           dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the
           head.

05:033:021 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in
           a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the
           heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and
           his judgments with Israel.

05:033:022 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from
           Bashan.

05:033:023 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,
           and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west
           and the south.

05:033:024 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let
           him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in
           oil.

05:033:025 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall
           thy strength be.

05:033:026 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon
           the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

05:033:027 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
           everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from
           before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.

05:033:028 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob
           shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall
           drop down dew.

05:033:029 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people
           saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the
           sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found
           liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

05:034:001 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
           Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And
           the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

05:034:002 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and
           all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

05:034:003 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the
           city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

05:034:004 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware
           unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give
           it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine
           eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.

05:034:005 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of
           Moab, according to the word of the LORD.

05:034:006 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over
           against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto
           this day.

05:034:007 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died:
           his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

05:034:008 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
           Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for
           Moses were ended.

05:034:009 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
           for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of
           Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

05:034:010 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
           whom the LORD knew face to face,

05:034:011 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to
           do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
           and to all his land,

05:034:012 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which
           Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.

Book 06        Joshua

06:001:001 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came
           to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun,
           Moses' minister, saying,

06:001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
           Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do
           give to them, even to the children of Israel.

06:001:003 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
           have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

06:001:004 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great
           river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and
           unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
           your coast.

06:001:005 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
           days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee:
           I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

06:001:006 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
           thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto
           their fathers to give them.

06:001:007 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest
           observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant
           commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the
           left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.

06:001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but
           thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
           observe to do according to all that is written therein: for
           then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt
           have good success.

06:001:009 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be
           not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is
           with thee whithersoever thou goest.

06:001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

06:001:011 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare
           you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this
           Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God
           giveth you to possess it.

06:001:012 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the
           tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

06:001:013 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD
           commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest,
           and hath given you this land.

06:001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
           the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
           shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
           valour, and help them;

06:001:015 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
           you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your
           God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
           possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave
           you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

06:001:016 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us
           we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

06:001:017 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
           hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he
           was with Moses.

06:001:018 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and
           will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest
           him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good
           courage.

06:002:001 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
           secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they
           went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged
           there.

06:002:002 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there
           came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to
           search out the country.

06:002:003 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
           the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine
           house: for they be come to search out all the country.

06:002:004 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus,
           There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:

06:002:005 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate,
           when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went
           I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake
           them.

06:002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid
           them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon
           the roof.

06:002:007 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the
           fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone
           out, they shut the gate.

06:002:008 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
           roof;

06:002:009 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you
           the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all
           the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

06:002:010 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red
           sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto
           the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side
           Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.

06:002:011 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
           neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
           of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and
           in earth beneath.

06:002:012 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
           have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto
           my father's house, and give me a true token:

06:002:013 And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my
           brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver
           our lives from death.

06:002:014 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
           this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given
           us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

06:002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
           house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

06:002:016 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
           pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
           the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

06:002:017 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
           oath which thou hast made us swear.

06:002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line
           of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down
           by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy
           brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.

06:002:019 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of
           thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head,
           and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in
           the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
           him.

06:002:020 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
           thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

06:002:021 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she
           sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet
           line in the window.

06:002:022 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there
           three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers
           sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

06:002:023 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
           passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him
           all things that befell them:

06:002:024 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into
           our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the
           country do faint because of us.

06:003:001 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
           Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of
           Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.

06:003:002 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
           through the host;

06:003:003 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of
           the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites
           bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
           it.

06:003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
           thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may
           know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this
           way heretofore.

06:003:005 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
           morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.

06:003:006 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of
           the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took
           up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

06:003:007 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to
           magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know
           that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.

06:003:008 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
           covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water
           of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

06:003:009 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and
           hear the words of the LORD your God.

06:003:010 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
           among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before
           you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the
           Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the
           Jebusites.

06:003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
           passeth over before you into Jordan.

06:003:012 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
           out of every tribe a man.

06:003:013 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of
           the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the
           earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of
           Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from
           above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

06:003:014 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents,
           to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the
           covenant before the people;

06:003:015 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
           feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim
           of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the
           time of harvest,)

06:003:016 That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up
           upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside
           Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,
           even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people
           passed over right against Jericho.

06:003:017 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the
           Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people
           were passed clean over Jordan.

06:004:001 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
           over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

06:004:002 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a
           man,

06:004:003 And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst
           of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood
           firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you,
           and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this
           night.

06:004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
           children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

06:004:005 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the
           LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every
           man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the
           number of the tribes of the children of Israel:

06:004:006 That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
           their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these
           stones?

06:004:007 Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut
           off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed
           over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these
           stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for
           ever.

06:004:008 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and
           took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD
           spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of
           the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto
           the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

06:004:009 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
           place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the
           covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.

06:004:010 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of
           Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded
           Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses
           commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.

06:004:011 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
           over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests,
           in the presence of the people.

06:004:012 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half
           the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children
           of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:

06:004:013 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the
           LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

06:004:014 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all
           Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the
           days of his life.

06:004:015 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

06:004:016 Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that
           they come up out of Jordan.

06:004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out
           of Jordan.

06:004:018 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
           covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan,
           and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry
           land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and
           flowed over all his banks, as they did before.

06:004:019 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
           first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of
           Jericho.

06:004:020 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
           Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

06:004:021 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
           children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What
           mean these stones?

06:004:022 Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over
           this Jordan on dry land.

06:004:023 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from
           before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God
           did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we
           were gone over:

06:004:024 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the
           LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God
           for ever.

06:005:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
           were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
           Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had
           dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of
           Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted,
           neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the
           children of Israel.

06:005:002 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp
           knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second
           time.

06:005:003 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children
           of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

06:005:004 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the
           people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the
           men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came
           out of Egypt.

06:005:005 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
           people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they
           came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

06:005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the
           wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which
           came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the
           voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not
           shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers
           that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and
           honey.

06:005:007 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them
           Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they
           had not circumcised them by the way.

06:005:008 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
           people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they
           were whole.

06:005:009 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
           reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the
           place is called Gilgal unto this day.

06:005:010 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
           passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the
           plains of Jericho.

06:005:011 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow
           after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the
           selfsame day.

06:005:012 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
           old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna
           any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan
           that year.

06:005:013 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he
           lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man
           over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua
           went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our
           adversaries?

06:005:014 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I
           now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did
           worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his
           servant?

06:005:015 And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy
           shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is
           holy. And Joshua did so.

06:006:001 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
           Israel: none went out, and none came in.

06:006:002 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine
           hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of
           valour.

06:006:003 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
           about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

06:006:004 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
           rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city
           seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

06:006:005 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast
           with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the
           trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and
           the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people
           shall ascend up every man straight before him.

06:006:006 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto
           them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests
           bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.

06:006:007 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city,
           and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.

06:006:008 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people,
           that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
           horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets:
           and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.

06:006:009 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
           trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests
           going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

06:006:010 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not
           shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any
           word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout;
           then shall ye shout.

06:006:011 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it
           once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

06:006:012 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
           the ark of the LORD.

06:006:013 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before
           the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the
           trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward
           came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and
           blowing with the trumpets.

06:006:014 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
           into the camp: so they did six days.

06:006:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
           about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the
           same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the
           city seven times.

06:006:016 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
           with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the
           LORD hath given you the city.

06:006:017 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
           therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she
           and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the
           messengers that we sent.

06:006:018 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,
           lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed
           thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

06:006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
           are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the
           treasury of the LORD.

06:006:020 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
           and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the
           trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the
           wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
           every man straight before him, and they took the city.

06:006:021 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
           and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the
           edge of the sword.

06:006:022 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
           country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the
           woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

06:006:023 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out
           Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and
           all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and
           left them without the camp of Israel.

06:006:024 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein:
           only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of
           iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.

06:006:025 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's
           household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel
           even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which
           Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

06:006:026 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the
           man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city
           Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn,
           and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.

06:006:027 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised
           throughout all the country.

06:007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the
           accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,
           the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed
           thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the
           children of Israel.

06:007:002 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside
           Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying,
           Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.

06:007:003 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all
           the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
           up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour
           thither; for they are but few.

06:007:004 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
           men: and they fled before the men of Ai.

06:007:005 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for
           they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and
           smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the
           people melted, and became as water.

06:007:006 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his
           face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the
           elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

06:007:007 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
           brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
           of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been
           content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!

06:007:008 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs
           before their enemies!

06:007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall
           hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name
           from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?

06:007:010 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest
           thou thus upon thy face?

06:007:011 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my
           covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of
           the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also,
           and they have put it even among their own stuff.

06:007:012 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
           enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because
           they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more,
           except ye destroy the accursed from among you.

06:007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against
           to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an
           accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not
           stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed
           thing from among you.

06:007:014 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
           tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh
           shall come according to the families thereof; and the family
           which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the
           household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.

06:007:015 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
           shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he
           hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he
           hath wrought folly in Israel.

06:007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
           their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

06:007:017 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of
           the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by
           man; and Zabdi was taken:

06:007:018 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
           Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of
           Judah, was taken.

06:007:019 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory
           to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and
           tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

06:007:020 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned
           against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

06:007:021 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and
           two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty
           shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and,
           behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and
           the silver under it.

06:007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
           behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

06:007:023 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought
           them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and
           laid them out before the LORD.

06:007:024 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of
           Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold,
           and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses,
           and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they
           brought them unto the valley of Achor.

06:007:025 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
           trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones,
           and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with
           stones.

06:007:026 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day.
           So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore
           the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto
           this day.

06:008:001 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou
           dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go
           up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and
           his people, and his city, and his land:

06:008:002 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto
           Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle
           thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an
           ambush for the city behind it.

06:008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against
           Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour,
           and sent them away by night.

06:008:004 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
           against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from
           the city, but be ye all ready:

06:008:005 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto
           the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out
           against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,

06:008:006 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from
           the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the
           first: therefore we will flee before them.

06:008:007 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the
           city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

06:008:008 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall
           set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD
           shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.

06:008:009 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in
           ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of
           Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

06:008:010 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the
           people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the
           people to Ai.

06:008:011 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
           went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched
           on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them
           and Ai.

06:008:012 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
           ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

06:008:013 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was
           on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west
           of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the
           valley.

06:008:014 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they
           hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out
           against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time
           appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were
           liers in ambush against him behind the city.

06:008:015 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
           them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

06:008:016 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to
           pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were
           drawn away from the city.

06:008:017 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not
           out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued
           after Israel.

06:008:018 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is
           in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And
           Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward
           the city.

06:008:019 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran
           as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered
           into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on
           fire.

06:008:020 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and,
           behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they
           had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that
           fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

06:008:021 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken
           the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they
           turned again, and slew the men of Ai.

06:008:022 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they
           were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on
           that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them
           remain or escape.

06:008:023 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

06:008:024 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying
           all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness
           wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the
           edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the
           Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the
           sword.

06:008:025 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
           women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

06:008:026 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out
           the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants
           of Ai.

06:008:027 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a
           prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD
           which he commanded Joshua.

06:008:028 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
           desolation unto this day.

06:008:029 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
           soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should
           take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the
           entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great
           heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.

06:008:030 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in
           mount Ebal,

06:008:031 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of
           Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an
           altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any
           iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD,
           and sacrificed peace offerings.

06:008:032 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
           which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

06:008:033 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their
           judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the
           priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them;
           half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over
           against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had
           commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

06:008:034 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings
           and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of
           the law.

06:008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
           read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the
           women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were
           conversant among them.

06:009:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this
           side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the
           coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and
           the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
           Jebusite, heard thereof;

06:009:002 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
           and with Israel, with one accord.

06:009:003 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
           unto Jericho and to Ai,

06:009:004 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
           ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine
           bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;

06:009:005 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments
           upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and
           mouldy.

06:009:006 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
           him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country:
           now therefore make ye a league with us.

06:009:007 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye
           dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?

06:009:008 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua
           said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?

06:009:009 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants
           are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have
           heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

06:009:010 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that
           were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king
           of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.

06:009:011 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country
           spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey,
           and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants:
           therefore now make ye a league with us.

06:009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
           on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it
           is dry, and it is mouldy:

06:009:013 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and,
           behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are
           become old by reason of the very long journey.

06:009:014 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at
           the mouth of the LORD.

06:009:015 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them,
           to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware
           unto them.

06:009:016 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had
           made a league with them, that they heard that they were their
           neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.

06:009:017 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their
           cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and
           Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

06:009:018 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes
           of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of
           Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.

06:009:019 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have
           sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we
           may not touch them.

06:009:020 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest
           wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto
           them.

06:009:021 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
           hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation;
           as the princes had promised them.

06:009:022 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
           Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from
           you; when ye dwell among us?

06:009:023 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be
           freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of
           water for the house of my God.

06:009:024 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
           told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his
           servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
           inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were
           sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this
           thing.

06:009:025 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
           right unto thee to do unto us, do.

06:009:026 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
           the children of Israel, that they slew them not.

06:009:027 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of
           water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD,
           even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

06:010:001 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had
           heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it;
           as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai
           and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace
           with Israel, and were among them;

06:010:002 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as
           one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
           and all the men thereof were mighty.

06:010:003 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king
           of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia
           king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

06:010:004 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it
           hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

06:010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of
           Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king
           of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together,
           and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before
           Gibeon, and made war against it.

06:010:006 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
           saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us
           quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the
           Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together
           against us.

06:010:007 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
           with him, and all the mighty men of valour.

06:010:008 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
           delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them
           stand before thee.

06:010:009 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from
           Gilgal all night.

06:010:010 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them
           with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the
           way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and
           unto Makkedah.

06:010:011 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
           in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great
           stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they
           were more which died with hailstones than they whom the
           children of Israel slew with the sword.

06:010:012 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD
           delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and
           he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon
           Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.

06:010:013 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
           had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written
           in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of
           heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

06:010:014 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
           LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought
           for Israel.

06:010:015 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
           Gilgal.

06:010:016 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
           Makkedah.

06:010:017 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid
           in a cave at Makkedah.

06:010:018 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
           and set men by it for to keep them:

06:010:019 And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
           hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities:
           for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.

06:010:020 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
           had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter,
           till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them
           entered into fenced cities.

06:010:021 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
           in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of
           Israel.

06:010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
           those five kings unto me out of the cave.

06:010:023 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him
           out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
           the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of
           Eglon.

06:010:024 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
           Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
           unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come
           near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they
           came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

06:010:025 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be
           strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all
           your enemies against whom ye fight.

06:010:026 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged
           them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until
           the evening.

06:010:027 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
           that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
           and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and
           laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this
           very day.

06:010:028 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge
           of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them,
           and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and
           he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of
           Jericho.

06:010:029 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him,
           unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

06:010:030 And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the
           hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword,
           and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it;
           but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of
           Jericho.

06:010:031 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
           Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

06:010:032 And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which
           took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the
           sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all
           that he had done to Libnah.

06:010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
           smote him and his people, until he had left him none
           remaining.

06:010:034 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
           him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

06:010:035 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of
           the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly
           destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to
           Lachish.

06:010:036 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
           Hebron; and they fought against it:

06:010:037 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
           the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the
           souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to
           all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and
           all the souls that were therein.

06:010:038 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
           fought against it:

06:010:039 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities
           thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and
           utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left
           none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir,
           and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to
           her king.

06:010:040 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the
           south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their
           kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that
           breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.

06:010:041 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and
           all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

06:010:042 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one
           time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

06:010:043 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
           Gilgal.

06:011:001 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
           things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king
           of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

06:011:002 And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and
           of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in
           the borders of Dor on the west,

06:011:003 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the
           Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite
           in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land
           of Mizpeh.

06:011:004 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
           people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in
           multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

06:011:005 And when all these kings were met together, they came and
           pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against
           Israel.

06:011:006 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them:
           for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain
           before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their
           chariots with fire.

06:011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against
           them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

06:011:008 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
           them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto
           Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and
           they smote them, until they left them none remaining.

06:011:009 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed
           their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

06:011:010 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
           the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the
           head of all those kingdoms.

06:011:011 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge
           of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left
           to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

06:011:012 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
           did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword,
           and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the
           LORD commanded.

06:011:013 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength,
           Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua
           burn.

06:011:014 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the
           children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every
           man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had
           destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.

06:011:015 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
           Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
           the LORD commanded Moses.

06:011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
           country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the
           plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

06:011:017 Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto
           Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all
           their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.

06:011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

06:011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children of
           Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other
           they took in battle.

06:011:020 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they
           should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy
           them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he
           might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.

06:011:021 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
           mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all
           the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel:
           Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.

06:011:022 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
           of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there
           remained.

06:011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
           said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto
           Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the
           land rested from war.

06:012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of
           Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side
           Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto
           mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:

06:012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled
           from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and
           from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto
           the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of
           Ammon;

06:012:003 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and
           unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the
           way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:

06:012:004 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant
           of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

06:012:005 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan,
           unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and
           half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

06:012:006 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of
           Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a
           possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
           tribe of Manasseh.

06:012:007 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
           children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from
           Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak,
           that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of
           Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

06:012:008 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and
           in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south
           country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the
           Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

06:012:009 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside
           Bethel, one;

06:012:010 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

06:012:011 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

06:012:012 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

06:012:013 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

06:012:014 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

06:012:015 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

06:012:016 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

06:012:017 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

06:012:018 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

06:012:019 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

06:012:020 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

06:012:021 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

06:012:022 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

06:012:023 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the
           nations of Gilgal, one;

06:012:024 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.

06:013:001 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said
           unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there
           remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

06:013:002 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
           Philistines, and all Geshuri,

06:013:003 From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of
           Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords
           of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the
           Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the
           Avites:

06:013:004 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
           that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the
           Amorites:

06:013:005 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the
           sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering
           into Hamath.

06:013:006 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
           Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out
           from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot
           unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded
           thee.

06:013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the
           nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

06:013:008 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
           inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward,
           even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;

06:013:009 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the
           city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of
           Medeba unto Dibon;

06:013:010 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which
           reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

06:013:011 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites,
           and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

06:013:012 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth
           and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for
           these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

06:013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the
           Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the
           Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.

06:013:014 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
           sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their
           inheritance, as he said unto them.

06:013:015 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
           inheritance according to their families.

06:013:016 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the
           river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river,
           and all the plain by Medeba;

06:013:017 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and
           Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,

06:013:018 And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

06:013:019 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of
           the valley,

06:013:020 And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

06:013:021 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
           king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses
           smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
           Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the
           country.

06:013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
           of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by
           them.

06:013:023 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
           border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of
           Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages
           thereof.

06:013:024 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto
           the children of Gad according to their families.

06:013:025 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
           half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is
           before Rabbah;

06:013:026 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from
           Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

06:013:027 And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and
           Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
           Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of
           Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.

06:013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
           families, the cities, and their villages.

06:013:029 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh:
           and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children
           of Manasseh by their families.

06:013:030 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
           of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in
           Bashan, threescore cities:

06:013:031 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the
           kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of
           Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the
           children of Machir by their families.

06:013:032 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
           inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan,
           by Jericho, eastward.

06:013:033 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the
           LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto
           them.

06:014:001 And these are the countries which the children of Israel
           inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and
           Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
           tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance
           to them.

06:014:002 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the
           hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

06:014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
           tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave
           none inheritance among them.

06:014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and
           Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the
           land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their
           cattle and for their substance.

06:014:005 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did,
           and they divided the land.

06:014:006 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
           Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou
           knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God
           concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.

06:014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent
           me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him
           word again as it was in mine heart.

06:014:008 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart
           of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

06:014:009 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
           thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy
           children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the
           LORD my God.

06:014:010 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said,
           these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this
           word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the
           wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five
           years old.

06:014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
           sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now,
           for war, both to go out, and to come in.

06:014:012 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
           that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were
           there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the
           LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out,
           as the LORD said.

06:014:013 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of
           Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.

06:014:014 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
           Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly
           followed the LORD God of Israel.

06:014:015 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was
           a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

06:015:001 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
           their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of
           Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.

06:015:002 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea,
           from the bay that looketh southward:

06:015:003 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and
           passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto
           Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar,
           and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

06:015:004 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the
           river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the
           sea: this shall be your south coast.

06:015:005 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
           Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay
           of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:

06:015:006 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the
           north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of
           Bohan the son of Reuben:

06:015:007 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
           and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the
           going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river:
           and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the
           goings out thereof were at Enrogel:

06:015:008 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto
           the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the
           border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before
           the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the
           valley of the giants northward:

06:015:009 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
           fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities
           of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is
           Kirjathjearim:

06:015:010 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
           and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is
           Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and
           passed on to Timnah:

06:015:011 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
           the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount
           Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the
           border were at the sea.

06:015:012 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast
           thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round
           about according to their families.

06:015:013 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
           children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to
           Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city
           is Hebron.

06:015:014 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
           Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

06:015:015 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the
           name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.

06:015:016 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
           to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

06:015:017 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
           and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

06:015:018 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him
           to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and
           Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?

06:015:019 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a
           south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the
           upper springs, and the nether springs.

06:015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
           according to their families.

06:015:021 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
           toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and
           Jagur,

06:015:022 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

06:015:023 And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

06:015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

06:015:025 And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

06:015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

06:015:027 And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,

06:015:028 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,

06:015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,

06:015:030 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

06:015:031 And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

06:015:032 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities
           are twenty and nine, with their villages:

06:015:033 And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

06:015:034 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

06:015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

06:015:036 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
           fourteen cities with their villages:

06:015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,

06:015:038 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,

06:015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

06:015:040 And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

06:015:041 And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen
           cities with their villages:

06:015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

06:015:043 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

06:015:044 And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their
           villages:

06:015:045 Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

06:015:046 From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with
           their villages:

06:015:047 Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns
           and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea,
           and the border thereof:

06:015:048 And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

06:015:049 And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,

06:015:050 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

06:015:051 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their
           villages:

06:015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

06:015:053 And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,

06:015:054 And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine
           cities with their villages:

06:015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

06:015:056 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

06:015:057 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

06:015:058 Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,

06:015:059 And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their
           villages:

06:015:060 Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities
           with their villages:

06:015:061 In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

06:015:062 And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with
           their villages.

06:015:063 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
           children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites
           dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

06:016:001 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
           Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the
           wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

06:016:002 And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the
           borders of Archi to Ataroth,

06:016:003 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the
           coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings
           out thereof are at the sea.

06:016:004 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
           inheritance.

06:016:005 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
           families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the
           east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

06:016:006 And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the
           north side; and the border went about eastward unto
           Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;

06:016:007 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and
           came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

06:016:008 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river
           Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the
           inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their
           families.

06:016:009 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
           the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities
           with their villages.

06:016:010 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
           the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and
           serve under tribute.

06:017:001 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
           firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of
           Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war,
           therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

06:017:002 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh
           by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the
           children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the
           children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for
           the children of Shemida: these were the male children of
           Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

06:017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son
           of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters:
           and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah,
           Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

06:017:004 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before
           Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The
           LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our
           brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD
           he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their
           father.

06:017:005 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
           Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;

06:017:006 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his
           sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

06:017:007 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
           lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right
           hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.

06:017:008 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the
           border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;

06:017:009 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the
           river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of
           Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of
           the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:

06:017:010 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
           and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on
           the north, and in Issachar on the east.

06:017:011 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
           towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
           and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and
           the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants
           of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.

06:017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the
           inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in
           that land.

06:017:013 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
           strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not
           utterly drive them out.

06:017:014 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
           thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I
           am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me
           hitherto?

06:017:015 And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get
           thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in
           the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim
           be too narrow for thee.

06:017:016 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for
           us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the
           valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean
           and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.

06:017:017 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
           to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great
           power: thou shalt not have one lot only:

06:017:018 But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou
           shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for
           thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron
           chariots, and though they be strong.

06:018:001 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
           together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the
           congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.

06:018:002 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
           which had not yet received their inheritance.

06:018:003 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
           slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your
           fathers hath given you?

06:018:004 Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will
           send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and
           describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they
           shall come again to me.

06:018:005 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide
           in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
           abide in their coasts on the north.

06:018:006 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and
           bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for
           you here before the LORD our God.

06:018:007 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of
           the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half
           the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond
           Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave
           them.

06:018:008 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
           went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the
           land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here
           cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.

06:018:009 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it
           by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua
           to the host at Shiloh.

06:018:010 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
           there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel
           according to their divisions.

06:018:011 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
           according to their families: and the coast of their lot came
           forth between the children of Judah and the children of
           Joseph.

06:018:012 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
           border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and
           went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out
           thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.

06:018:013 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side
           of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended
           to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of
           the nether Bethhoron.

06:018:014 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of
           the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron
           southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal,
           which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this
           was the west quarter.

06:018:015 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and
           the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of
           waters of Nephtoah:

06:018:016 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth
           before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the
           valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley
           of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended
           to Enrogel,

06:018:017 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
           went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up
           of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of
           Reuben,

06:018:018 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah
           northward, and went down unto Arabah:

06:018:019 And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah
           northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north
           bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the
           south coast.

06:018:020 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
           inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof
           round about, according to their families.

06:018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
           according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and
           the valley of Keziz,

06:018:022 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

06:018:023 And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,

06:018:024 And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with
           their villages:

06:018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

06:018:026 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

06:018:027 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

06:018:028 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and
           Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the
           inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their
           families.

06:019:001 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of
           the children of Simeon according to their families: and their
           inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of
           Judah.

06:019:002 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and
           Moladah,

06:019:003 And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

06:019:004 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

06:019:005 And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

06:019:006 And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their
           villages:

06:019:007 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their
           villages:

06:019:008 And all the villages that were round about these cities to
           Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of
           the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
           families.

06:019:009 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the
           inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the
           children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the
           children of Simeon had their inheritance within the
           inheritance of them.

06:019:010 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun
           according to their families: and the border of their
           inheritance was unto Sarid:

06:019:011 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
           reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before
           Jokneam;

06:019:012 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the
           border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and
           goeth up to Japhia,

06:019:013 And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher,
           to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

06:019:014 And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon:
           and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

06:019:015 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
           Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

06:019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
           to their families, these cities with their villages.

06:019:017 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
           Issachar according to their families.

06:019:018 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and
           Shunem,

06:019:019 And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,

06:019:020 And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

06:019:021 And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

06:019:022 And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and
           Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan:
           sixteen cities with their villages.

06:019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
           Issachar according to their families, the cities and their
           villages.

06:019:024 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
           Asher according to their families.

06:019:025 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and
           Achshaph,

06:019:026 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
           westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

06:019:027 And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to
           Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side
           of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left
           hand,

06:019:028 And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great
           Zidon;

06:019:029 And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city
           Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings
           thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:

06:019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with
           their villages.

06:019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
           according to their families, these cities with their villages.

06:019:032 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for
           the children of Naphtali according to their families.

06:019:033 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and
           Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings
           thereof were at Jordan:

06:019:034 And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth
           out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the
           south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to
           Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

06:019:035 And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
           and Chinnereth,

06:019:036 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

06:019:037 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

06:019:038 And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh;
           nineteen cities with their villages.

06:019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
           Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their
           villages.

06:019:040 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of
           Dan according to their families.

06:019:041 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
           Irshemesh,

06:019:042 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

06:019:043 And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

06:019:044 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

06:019:045 And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

06:019:046 And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

06:019:047 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for
           them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against
           Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
           and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
           after the name of Dan their father.

06:019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
           according to their families, these cities with their villages.

06:019:049 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
           by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to
           Joshua the son of Nun among them:

06:019:050 According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which
           he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the
           city, and dwelt therein.

06:019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and
           Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
           tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance
           by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of
           dividing the country.

06:020:001 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,

06:020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you
           cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of
           Moses:

06:020:003 That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and
           unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge
           from the avenger of blood.

06:020:004 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall
           stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall
           declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they
           shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place,
           that he may dwell among them.

06:020:005 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
           not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his
           neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

06:020:006 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
           congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high
           priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer
           return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house,
           unto the city from whence he fled.

06:020:007 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
           Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in
           the mountain of Judah.

06:020:008 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they
           assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the
           tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad,
           and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

06:020:009 These were the cities appointed for all the children of
           Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that
           whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither,
           and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he
           stood before the congregation.

06:021:001 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
           Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto
           the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of
           Israel;

06:021:002 And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
           saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us
           cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.

06:021:003 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
           inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and
           their suburbs.

06:021:004 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and
           the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites,
           had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
           Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

06:021:005 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the
           families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
           and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

06:021:006 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of
           the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out
           of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of
           Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

06:021:007 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe
           of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe
           of Zebulun, twelve cities.

06:021:008 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these
           cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand
           of Moses.

06:021:009 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and
           out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which
           are here mentioned by name.

06:021:010 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
           Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs
           was the first lot.

06:021:011 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
           city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs
           thereof round about it.

06:021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave
           they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

06:021:013 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with
           her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah
           with her suburbs,

06:021:014 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,

06:021:015 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,

06:021:016 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
           Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two
           tribes.

06:021:017 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs,
           Geba with her suburbs,

06:021:018 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
           thirteen cities with their suburbs.

06:021:020 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
           remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities
           of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

06:021:021 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim,
           to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her
           suburbs,

06:021:022 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs;
           four cities.

06:021:023 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs,
           Gibbethon with her suburbs,

06:021:024 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:025 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her
           suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

06:021:026 All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of
           the children of Kohath that remained.

06:021:027 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the
           Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave
           Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for
           the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.

06:021:028 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,
           Dabareh with her suburbs,

06:021:029 Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:030 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon
           with her suburbs,

06:021:031 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:032 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
           suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor
           with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

06:021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
           were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

06:021:034 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of
           the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her
           suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,

06:021:035 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:036 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
           Jahazah with her suburbs,

06:021:037 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:038 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her
           suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim
           with her suburbs,

06:021:039 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities
           in all.

06:021:040 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their
           families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites,
           were by their lot twelve cities.

06:021:041 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
           children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their
           suburbs.

06:021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about
           them: thus were all these cities.

06:021:043 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
           give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt
           therein.

06:021:044 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that
           he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all
           their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their
           enemies into their hand.

06:021:045 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
           spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

06:022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
           half tribe of Manasseh,

06:022:002 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of
           the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I
           commanded you:

06:022:003 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day,
           but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your
           God.

06:022:004 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren,
           as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto
           your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses
           the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

06:022:005 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law,
           which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the
           LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
           commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with
           all your heart and with all your soul.

06:022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto
           their tents.

06:022:007 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
           possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave
           Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And
           when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he
           blessed them,

06:022:008 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto
           your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with
           gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much
           raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

06:022:009 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
           half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the
           children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of
           Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their
           possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word
           of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

06:022:010 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the
           land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
           and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan,
           a great altar to see to.

06:022:011 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of
           Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh
           have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the
           borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.

06:022:012 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole
           congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves
           together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.

06:022:013 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben,
           and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh,
           into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
           priest,

06:022:014 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince
           throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head
           of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.

06:022:015 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
           of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of
           Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,

06:022:016 Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass
           is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to
           turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have
           builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the
           LORD?

06:022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are
           not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in
           the congregation of the LORD,

06:022:018 But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD?
           and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that
           to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of
           Israel.

06:022:019 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean,
           then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD,
           wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession
           among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against
           us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our
           God.

06:022:020 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the
           accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of
           Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.

06:022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
           half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of
           the thousands of Israel,

06:022:022 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and
           Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in
           transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)

06:022:023 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the
           LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering,
           or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself
           require it;

06:022:024 And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing,
           saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our
           children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of
           Israel?

06:022:025 For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye
           children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the
           LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from
           fearing the LORD.

06:022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
           not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

06:022:027 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our
           generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD
           before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
           and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say
           to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.

06:022:028 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say
           to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say
           again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our
           fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but
           it is a witness between us and you.

06:022:029 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn
           this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt
           offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the
           altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.

06:022:030 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
           congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were
           with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the
           children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased
           them.

06:022:031 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
           children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the
           children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is
           among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against
           the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of
           the hand of the LORD.

06:022:032 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
           returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of
           Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to
           the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

06:022:033 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children
           of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against
           them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of
           Reuben and Gad dwelt.

06:022:034 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
           altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD
           is God.

06:023:001 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
           rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that
           Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.

06:023:002 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and
           for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,
           and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:

06:023:003 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all
           these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that
           hath fought for you.

06:023:004 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that
           remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,
           with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great
           sea westward.

06:023:005 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you,
           and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess
           their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.

06:023:006 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
           written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not
           aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;

06:023:007 That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among
           you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause
           to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto
           them:

06:023:008 But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this
           day.

06:023:009 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
           strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before
           you unto this day.

06:023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God,
           he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

06:023:011 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the
           LORD your God.

06:023:012 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
           of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall
           make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to
           you:

06:023:013 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive
           out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be
           snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and
           thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land
           which the LORD your God hath given you.

06:023:014 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and
           ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one
           thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your
           God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and
           not one thing hath failed thereof.

06:023:015 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
           come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall
           the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have
           destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God
           hath given you.

06:023:016 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
           which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods,
           and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD
           be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off
           the good land which he hath given unto you.

06:024:001 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
           called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for
           their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
           themselves before God.

06:024:002 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God
           of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood
           in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
           of Nachor: and they served other gods.

06:024:003 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the
           flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and
           multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

06:024:004 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau
           mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went
           down into Egypt.

06:024:005 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
           that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

06:024:006 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
           sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with
           chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

06:024:007 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
           and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered
           them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and
           ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.

06:024:008 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt
           on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave
           them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I
           destroyed them from before you.

06:024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
           against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to
           curse you:

06:024:010 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you
           still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

06:024:011 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men
           of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the
           Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
           Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered
           them into your hand.

06:024:012 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
           before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with
           thy sword, nor with thy bow.

06:024:013 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
           cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the
           vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

06:024:014 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
           truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the
           other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

06:024:015 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you
           this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your
           fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or
           the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for
           me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

06:024:016 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
           forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;

06:024:017 For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our
           fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
           and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
           in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people
           through whom we passed:

06:024:018 And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the
           Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve
           the LORD; for he is our God.

06:024:019 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
           he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
           your transgressions nor your sins.

06:024:020 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
           turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done
           you good.

06:024:021 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
           LORD.

06:024:022 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
           yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And
           they said, We are witnesses.

06:024:023 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
           among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

06:024:024 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we
           serve, and his voice will we obey.

06:024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
           them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

06:024:026 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
           and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that
           was by the sanctuary of the LORD.

06:024:027 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall
           be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the
           LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness
           unto you, lest ye deny your God.

06:024:028 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his
           inheritance.

06:024:029 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
           Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten
           years old.

06:024:030 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
           Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of
           the hill of Gaash.

06:024:031 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
           days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known
           all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.

06:024:032 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
           up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground
           which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem
           for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance
           of the children of Joseph.

06:024:033 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a
           hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him
           in mount Ephraim.

Book 07        Judges

07:001:001 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the
           children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for
           us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?

07:001:002 And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered
           the land into his hand.

07:001:003 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into
           my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I
           likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with
           him.

07:001:004 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and
           the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
           ten thousand men.

07:001:005 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against
           him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

07:001:006 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
           him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

07:001:007 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
           thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under
           my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
           brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

07:001:008 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and
           had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and
           set the city on fire.

07:001:009 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
           the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south,
           and in the valley.

07:001:010 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
           (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew
           Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

07:001:011 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and
           the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:

07:001:012 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
           to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

07:001:013 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
           it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

07:001:014 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him
           to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her
           ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?

07:001:015 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
           me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave
           her the upper springs and the nether springs.

07:001:016 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up
           out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into
           the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and
           they went and dwelt among the people.

07:001:017 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
           Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
           And the name of the city was called Hormah.

07:001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with
           the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

07:001:019 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants
           of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of
           the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

07:001:020 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he
           expelled thence the three sons of Anak.

07:001:021 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
           that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the
           children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

07:001:022 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
           the LORD was with them.

07:001:023 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name
           of the city before was Luz.)

07:001:024 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
           said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
           city, and we will shew thee mercy.

07:001:025 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
           the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man
           and all his family.

07:001:026 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a
           city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name
           thereof unto this day.

07:001:027 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean
           and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants
           of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her
           towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the
           Canaanites would dwell in that land.

07:001:028 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
           Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

07:001:029 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
           Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

07:001:030 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
           the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among
           them, and became tributaries.

07:001:031 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
           inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
           Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:

07:001:032 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
           of the land: for they did not drive them out.

07:001:033 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
           nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the
           Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
           inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries
           unto them.

07:001:034 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
           for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:

07:001:035 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
           Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so
           that they became tributaries.

07:001:036 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to
           Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

07:002:001 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and
           said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you
           unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I
           will never break my covenant with you.

07:002:002 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
           ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my
           voice: why have ye done this?

07:002:003 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before
           you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods
           shall be a snare unto you.

07:002:004 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these
           words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted
           up their voice, and wept.

07:002:005 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
           sacrificed there unto the LORD.

07:002:006 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
           went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

07:002:007 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all
           the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all
           the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

07:002:008 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,
           being an hundred and ten years old.

07:002:009 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
           Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of
           the hill Gaash.

07:002:010 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
           and there arose another generation after them, which knew not
           the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.

07:002:011 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
           and served Baalim:

07:002:012 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought
           them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
           gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed
           themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

07:002:013 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

07:002:014 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
           delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them,
           and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
           so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

07:002:015 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
           them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn
           unto them: and they were greatly distressed.

07:002:016 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them
           out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

07:002:017 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
           went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto
           them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers
           walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did
           not so.

07:002:018 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was
           with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their
           enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD
           because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed
           them and vexed them.

07:002:019 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they
           returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in
           following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them;
           they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn
           way.

07:002:020 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
           Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
           commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

07:002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of
           the nations which Joshua left when he died:

07:002:022 That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
           the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep
           it, or not.

07:002:023 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them
           out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of
           Joshua.

07:003:001 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel
           by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars
           of Canaan;

07:003:002 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might
           know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew
           nothing thereof;

07:003:003 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
           and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
           Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

07:003:004 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
           would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he
           commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

07:003:005 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
           Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and
           Jebusites:

07:003:006 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
           their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

07:003:007 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
           and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the
           groves.

07:003:008 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
           sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of
           Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served
           Chushanrishathaim eight years.

07:003:009 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
           raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered
           them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

07:003:010 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged
           Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered
           Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his
           hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

07:003:011 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of
           Kenaz died.

07:003:012 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
           LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against
           Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

07:003:013 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
           went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

07:003:014 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab
           eighteen years.

07:003:015 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
           raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite,
           a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a
           present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

07:003:016 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
           length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right
           thigh.

07:003:017 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon
           was a very fat man.

07:003:018 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
           the people that bare the present.

07:003:019 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
           Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king:
           who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out
           from him.

07:003:020 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer
           parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have
           a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.

07:003:021 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
           right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

07:003:022 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
           upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of
           his belly; and the dirt came out.

07:003:023 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of
           the parlour upon him, and locked them.

07:003:024 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw
           that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said,
           Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

07:003:025 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he
           opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a
           key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down
           dead on the earth.

07:003:026 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
           quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

07:003:027 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet
           in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went
           down with him from the mount, and he before them.

07:003:028 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath
           delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they
           went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
           and suffered not a man to pass over.

07:003:029 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
           lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

07:003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
           land had rest fourscore years.

07:003:031 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
           Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also
           delivered Israel.

07:004:001 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
           LORD, when Ehud was dead.

07:004:002 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
           that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera,
           which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

07:004:003 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had
           nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily
           oppressed the children of Israel.

07:004:004 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
           Israel at that time.

07:004:005 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
           Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to
           her for judgment.

07:004:006 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
           Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of
           Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and
           take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
           and of the children of Zebulun?

07:004:007 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the
           captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
           and I will deliver him into thine hand.

07:004:008 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
           go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

07:004:009 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
           journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for
           the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And
           Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.

07:004:010 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went
           up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with
           him.

07:004:011 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
           father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites,
           and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by
           Kedesh.

07:004:012 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone
           up to mount Tabor.

07:004:013 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine
           hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with
           him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

07:004:014 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which
           the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the
           LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount
           Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

07:004:015 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
           his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that
           Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his
           feet.

07:004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
           Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell
           upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

07:004:017 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the
           wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin
           the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

07:004:018 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,
           my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in
           unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

07:004:019 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
           drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and
           gave him drink, and covered him.

07:004:020 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
           shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say,
           Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

07:004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
           hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the
           nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he
           was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

07:004:022 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet
           him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man
           whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold,
           Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.

07:004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
           children of Israel.

07:004:024 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and
           prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had
           destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

07:005:001 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
           saying,

07:005:002 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
           willingly offered themselves.

07:005:003 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
           unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.

07:005:004 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out
           of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
           dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

07:005:005 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai
           from before the LORD God of Israel.

07:005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
           the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked
           through byways.

07:005:007 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
           until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

07:005:008 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a
           shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

07:005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered
           themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

07:005:010 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment,
           and walk by the way.

07:005:011 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the
           places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the
           righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the
           inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people
           of the LORD go down to the gates.

07:005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
           Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

07:005:013 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
           among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the
           mighty.

07:005:014 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
           thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down
           governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the
           writer.

07:005:015 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar,
           and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the
           divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

07:005:016 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings
           of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great
           searchings of heart.

07:005:017 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
           Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

07:005:018 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
           unto the death in the high places of the field.

07:005:019 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
           Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

07:005:020 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
           against Sisera.

07:005:021 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
           river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

07:005:022 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
           the pransings of their mighty ones.

07:005:023 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly
           the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of
           the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

07:005:024 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
           be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

07:005:025 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth
           butter in a lordly dish.

07:005:026 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the
           workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she
           smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through
           his temples.

07:005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he
           bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

07:005:028 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
           the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry
           the wheels of his chariots?

07:005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to
           herself,

07:005:030 Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every
           man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a
           prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of
           needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take
           the spoil?

07:005:031 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that
           love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And
           the land had rest forty years.

07:006:001 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD:
           and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven
           years.

07:006:002 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because
           of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens
           which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

07:006:003 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came
           up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even
           they came up against them;

07:006:004 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of
           the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance
           for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

07:006:005 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they
           came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their
           camels were without number: and they entered into the land to
           destroy it.

07:006:006 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites;
           and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

07:006:007 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto
           the LORD because of the Midianites,

07:006:008 That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel,
           which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I
           brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the
           house of bondage;

07:006:009 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out
           of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from
           before you, and gave you their land;

07:006:010 And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods
           of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not
           obeyed my voice.

07:006:011 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak
           which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite:
           and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it
           from the Midianites.

07:006:012 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto
           him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

07:006:013 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us,
           why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his
           miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the
           LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken
           us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

07:006:014 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might,
           and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites:
           have not I sent thee?

07:006:015 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save
           Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
           least in my father's house.

07:006:016 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and
           thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

07:006:017 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
           then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

07:006:018 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and
           bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I
           will tarry until thou come again.

07:006:019 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
           of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put
           the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak,
           and presented it.

07:006:020 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
           unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out
           the broth. And he did so.

07:006:021 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that
           was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened
           cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed
           the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD
           departed out of his sight.

07:006:022 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
           Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an
           angel of the LORD face to face.

07:006:023 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
           shalt not die.

07:006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
           Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the
           Abiezrites.

07:006:025 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
           him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock
           of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy
           father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:

07:006:026 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this
           rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and
           offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou
           shalt cut down.

07:006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD
           had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his
           father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not
           do it by day, that he did it by night.

07:006:028 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
           behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut
           down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon
           the altar that was built.

07:006:029 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And
           when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of
           Joash hath done this thing.

07:006:030 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son,
           that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal,
           and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

07:006:031 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead
           for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let
           him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god,
           let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his
           altar.

07:006:032 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let
           Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

07:006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
           the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in
           the valley of Jezreel.

07:006:034 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
           trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.

07:006:035 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
           gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and
           unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet
           them.

07:006:036 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine
           hand, as thou hast said,

07:006:037 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the
           dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth
           beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine
           hand, as thou hast said.

07:006:038 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust
           the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a
           bowl full of water.

07:006:039 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against
           me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee,
           but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the
           fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

07:006:040 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece
           only, and there was dew on all the ground.

07:007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were
           with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod:
           so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of
           them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

07:007:002 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee
           are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands,
           lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand
           hath saved me.

07:007:003 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people,
           saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and
           depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the
           people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten
           thousand.

07:007:004 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many;
           bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee
           there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This
           shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of
           whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the
           same shall not go.

07:007:005 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD
           said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his
           tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself;
           likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

07:007:006 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to
           their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the
           people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.

07:007:007 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
           lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine
           hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his
           place.

07:007:008 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets:
           and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent,
           and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian
           was beneath him in the valley.

07:007:009 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
           him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered
           it into thine hand.

07:007:010 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant
           down to the host:

07:007:011 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine
           hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he
           down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men
           that were in the host.

07:007:012 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
           the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for
           multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand
           by the sea side for multitude.

07:007:013 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
           dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream,
           and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of
           Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
           overturned it, that the tent lay along.

07:007:014 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save
           the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for
           into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

07:007:015 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
           the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned
           into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath
           delivered into your hand the host of Midian.

07:007:016 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and
           he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and
           lamps within the pitchers.

07:007:017 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and,
           behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be
           that, as I do, so shall ye do.

07:007:018 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then
           blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
           say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

07:007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto
           the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch;
           and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the
           trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.

07:007:020 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
           pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the
           trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried,
           The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

07:007:021 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp;
           and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

07:007:022 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set
           every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the
           host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the
           border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

07:007:023 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
           Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
           pursued after the Midianites.

07:007:024 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,
           saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them
           the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of
           Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto
           Bethbarah and Jordan.

07:007:025 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
           and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at
           the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the
           heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

07:008:001 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
           thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight
           with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.

07:008:002 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of
           you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
           the vintage of Abiezer?

07:008:003 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb
           and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then
           their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

07:008:004 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
           hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

07:008:005 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves
           of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint,
           and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

07:008:006 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
           Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto
           thine army?

07:008:007 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah
           and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with
           the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.

07:008:008 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise:
           and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had
           answered him.

07:008:009 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
           again in peace, I will break down this tower.

07:008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with
           them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all
           the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an
           hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.

07:008:011 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on
           the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the
           host was secure.

07:008:012 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and
           took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and
           discomfited all the host.

07:008:013 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the
           sun was up,

07:008:014 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of
           him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the
           elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

07:008:015 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah
           and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the
           hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should
           give bread unto thy men that are weary?

07:008:016 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the
           wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
           Succoth.

07:008:017 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
           city.

07:008:018 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
           they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so
           were they; each one resembled the children of a king.

07:008:019 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my
           mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
           would not slay you.

07:008:020 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
           the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was
           yet a youth.

07:008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for
           as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew
           Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on
           their camels' necks.

07:008:022 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,
           both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast
           delivered us from the hand of Midian.

07:008:023 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
           shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

07:008:024 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,
           that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For
           they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

07:008:025 And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they
           spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings
           of his prey.

07:008:026 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
           thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments,
           and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
           Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels'
           necks.

07:008:027 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even
           in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it:
           which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

07:008:028 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
           they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in
           quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.

07:008:029 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own
           house.

07:008:030 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten:
           for he had many wives.

07:008:031 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a
           son, whose name he called Abimelech.

07:008:032 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
           buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the
           Abiezrites.

07:008:033 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
           children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after
           Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.

07:008:034 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God,
           who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies
           on every side:

07:008:035 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
           namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
           shewed unto Israel.

07:009:001 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
           mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the
           family of the house of his mother's father, saying,

07:009:002 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
           Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of
           Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over
           you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your
           bone and your flesh.

07:009:003 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the
           men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to
           follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

07:009:004 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of
           the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and
           light persons, which followed him.

07:009:005 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his
           brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten
           persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the
           youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.

07:009:006 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the
           house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the
           plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.

07:009:007 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top
           of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said
           unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may
           hearken unto you.

07:009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
           they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

07:009:009 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
           wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted
           over the trees?

07:009:010 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over
           us.

07:009:011 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my
           sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the
           trees?

07:009:012 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over
           us.

07:009:013 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
           cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

07:009:014 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign
           over us.

07:009:015 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me
           king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and
           if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the
           cedars of Lebanon.

07:009:016 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye
           have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with
           Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to
           the deserving of his hands;

07:009:017 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far,
           and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

07:009:018 And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and
           have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one
           stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant,
           king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)

07:009:019 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and
           with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let
           him also rejoice in you:

07:009:020 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the
           men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out
           from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and
           devour Abimelech.

07:009:021 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt
           there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.

07:009:022 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

07:009:023 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of
           Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with
           Abimelech:

07:009:024 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of
           Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech
           their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem,
           which aided him in the killing of his brethren.

07:009:025 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
           the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by
           them: and it was told Abimelech.

07:009:026 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over
           to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in
           him.

07:009:027 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their
           vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into
           the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed
           Abimelech.

07:009:028 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is
           Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of
           Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the
           father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?

07:009:029 And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I
           remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine
           army, and come out.

07:009:030 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
           the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

07:009:031 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
           Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and,
           behold, they fortify the city against thee.

07:009:032 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with
           thee, and lie in wait in the field:

07:009:033 And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is
           up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold,
           when he and the people that is with him come out against thee,
           then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.

07:009:034 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him,
           by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four
           companies.

07:009:035 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering
           of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people
           that were with him, from lying in wait.

07:009:036 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
           come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said
           unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they
           were men.

07:009:037 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by
           the middle of the land, and another company come along by the
           plain of Meonenim.

07:009:038 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith
           thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is
           not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray
           now, and fight with them.

07:009:039 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
           Abimelech.

07:009:040 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many
           were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the
           gate.

07:009:041 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and
           his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

07:009:042 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out
           into the field; and they told Abimelech.

07:009:043 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
           and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the
           people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against
           them, and smote them.

07:009:044 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed
           forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city:
           and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were
           in the fields, and slew them.

07:009:045 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he
           took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat
           down the city, and sowed it with salt.

07:009:046 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
           entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

07:009:047 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
           Shechem were gathered together.

07:009:048 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the
           people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his
           hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and
           laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were
           with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I
           have done.

07:009:049 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
           followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold
           on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem
           died also, about a thousand men and women.

07:009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
           and took it.

07:009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
           all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it
           to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.

07:009:052 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
           went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

07:009:053 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon
           Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.

07:009:054 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer,
           and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say
           not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him
           through, and he died.

07:009:055 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
           departed every man unto his place.

07:009:056 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
           unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

07:009:057 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon
           their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of
           Jerubbaal.

07:010:001 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son
           of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in
           Shamir in mount Ephraim.

07:010:002 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
           buried in Shamir.

07:010:003 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel
           twenty and two years.

07:010:004 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they
           had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day,
           which are in the land of Gilead.

07:010:005 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

07:010:006 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
           LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria,
           and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of
           the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and
           forsook the LORD, and served not him.

07:010:007 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
           them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of
           the children of Ammon.

07:010:008 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
           eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the
           other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in
           Gilead.

07:010:009 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
           also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the
           house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.

07:010:010 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We
           have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our
           God, and also served Baalim.

07:010:011 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I
           deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from
           the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?

07:010:012 The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did
           oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of
           their hand.

07:010:013 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I
           will deliver you no more.

07:010:014 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them
           deliver you in the time of your tribulation.

07:010:015 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:
           do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us
           only, we pray thee, this day.

07:010:016 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served
           the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

07:010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and
           encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled
           themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.

07:010:018 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What
           man is he that will begin to fight against the children of
           Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

07:011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he
           was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

07:011:002 And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up,
           and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt
           not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a
           strange woman.

07:011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
           Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went
           out with him.

07:011:004 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of
           Ammon made war against Israel.

07:011:005 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war
           against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah
           out of the land of Tob:

07:011:006 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we
           may fight with the children of Ammon.

07:011:007 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate
           me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come
           unto me now when ye are in distress?

07:011:008 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn
           again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight
           against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the
           inhabitants of Gilead.

07:011:009 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me
           home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the
           LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?

07:011:010 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be
           witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.

07:011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
           made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all
           his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

07:011:012 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
           Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art
           come against me to fight in my land?

07:011:013 And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the
           messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when
           they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and
           unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again
           peaceably.

07:011:014 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the
           children of Ammon:

07:011:015 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away
           the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:

07:011:016 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
           wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

07:011:017 Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let
           me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom
           would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto
           the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode
           in Kadesh.

07:011:018 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
           land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
           of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
           but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the
           border of Moab.

07:011:019 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
           the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we
           pray thee, through thy land into my place.

07:011:020 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but
           Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz,
           and fought against Israel.

07:011:021 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people
           into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel
           possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of
           that country.

07:011:022 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
           even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

07:011:023 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
           from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?

07:011:024 Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee
           to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out
           from before us, them will we possess.

07:011:025 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of
           Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or
           did he ever fight against them,

07:011:026 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and
           her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts
           of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not
           recover them within that time?

07:011:027 Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me
           wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day
           between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

07:011:028 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto
           the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

07:011:029 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
           over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
           and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of
           Ammon.

07:011:030 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou
           shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine
           hands,

07:011:031 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of
           my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
           of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up
           for a burnt offering.

07:011:032 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
           against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.

07:011:033 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
           even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with
           a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were
           subdued before the children of Israel.

07:011:034 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
           daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances:
           and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor
           daughter.

07:011:035 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his
           clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me
           very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have
           opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.

07:011:036 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy
           mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath
           proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken
           vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of
           Ammon.

07:011:037 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me:
           let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the
           mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

07:011:038 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
           went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
           mountains.

07:011:039 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she
           returned unto her father, who did with her according to his
           vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a
           custom in Israel,

07:011:040 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the
           daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

07:012:001 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
           northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou
           over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not
           call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee
           with fire.

07:012:002 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great
           strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye
           delivered me not out of their hands.

07:012:003 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
           hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the
           LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come
           up unto me this day, to fight against me?

07:012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and
           fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim,
           because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim
           among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.

07:012:005 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
           Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which
           were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said
           unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

07:012:006 Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said
           Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then
           they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and
           there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two
           thousand.

07:012:007 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
           Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

07:012:008 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

07:012:009 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
           abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.
           And he judged Israel seven years.

07:012:010 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

07:012:011 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
           Israel ten years.

07:012:012 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
           country of Zebulun.

07:012:013 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
           Israel.

07:012:014 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
           threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight
           years.

07:012:015 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was
           buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the
           Amalekites.

07:013:001 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
           LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the
           Philistines forty years.

07:013:002 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
           Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and
           bare not.

07:013:003 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said
           unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but
           thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

07:013:004 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor
           strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

07:013:005 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
           shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
           God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of
           the hand of the Philistines.

07:013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
           came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of
           an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he
           was, neither told he me his name:

07:013:007 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a
           son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any
           unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from
           the womb to the day of his death.

07:013:008 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the
           man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach
           us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

07:013:009 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
           came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah
           her husband was not with her.

07:013:010 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
           said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that
           came unto me the other day.

07:013:011 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the
           man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the
           woman? And he said, I am.

07:013:012 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we
           order the child, and how shall we do unto him?

07:013:013 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said
           unto the woman let her beware.

07:013:014 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
           let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing:
           all that I commanded her let her observe.

07:013:015 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let
           us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

07:013:016 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
           me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a
           burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah
           knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.

07:013:017 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
           that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

07:013:018 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus
           after my name, seeing it is secret?

07:013:019 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon
           a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and
           Manoah and his wife looked on.

07:013:020 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
           off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the
           flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and
           fell on their faces to the ground.

07:013:021 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
           his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

07:013:022 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
           have seen God.

07:013:023 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill
           us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat
           offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all
           these things, nor would as at this time have told us such
           things as these.

07:013:024 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
           child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

07:013:025 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
           camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

07:014:001 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
           the daughters of the Philistines.

07:014:002 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
           I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
           Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

07:014:003 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
           woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
           people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
           Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me;
           for she pleaseth me well.

07:014:004 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the
           LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for
           at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

07:014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
           Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a
           young lion roared against him.

07:014:006 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
           him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his
           hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had
           done.

07:014:007 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
           Samson well.

07:014:008 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside
           to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm
           of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.

07:014:009 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came
           to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat:
           but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the
           carcase of the lion.

07:014:010 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there
           a feast; for so used the young men to do.

07:014:011 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought
           thirty companions to be with him.

07:014:012 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto
           you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days
           of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
           sheets and thirty change of garments:

07:014:013 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty
           sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him,
           Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

07:014:014 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and
           out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in
           three days expound the riddle.

07:014:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
           Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us
           the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with
           fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?

07:014:016 And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
           hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto
           the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he
           said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my
           mother, and shall I tell it thee?

07:014:017 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast
           lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told
           her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to
           the children of her people.

07:014:018 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day
           before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what
           is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not
           plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

07:014:019 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
           Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
           and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the
           riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his
           father's house.

07:014:020 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
           as his friend.

07:015:001 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
           harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said,
           I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would
           not suffer him to go in.

07:015:002 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
           hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her
           younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead
           of her.

07:015:003 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
           than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

07:015:004 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
           firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in
           the midst between two tails.

07:015:005 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
           the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the
           shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and
           olives.

07:015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they
           answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he
           had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the
           Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.

07:015:007 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will
           I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

07:015:008 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
           went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

07:015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
           themselves in Lehi.

07:015:010 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
           they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as
           he hath done to us.

07:015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
           Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the
           Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast
           done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so
           have I done unto them.

07:015:012 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
           may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson
           said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me
           yourselves.

07:015:013 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee
           fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not
           kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought
           him up from the rock.

07:015:014 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against
           him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and
           the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was
           burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.

07:015:015 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
           and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

07:015:016 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
           with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

07:015:017 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
           he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that
           place Ramathlehi.

07:015:018 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said,
           Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy
           servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the
           hand of the uncircumcised?

07:015:019 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there
           came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came
           again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof
           Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.

07:015:020 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
           years.

07:016:001 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in
           unto her.

07:016:002 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither.
           And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in
           the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In
           the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.

07:016:003 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took
           the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went
           away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders,
           and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before
           Hebron.

07:016:004 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
           valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

07:016:005 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said
           unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength
           lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we
           may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one
           of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

07:016:006 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
           great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
           afflict thee.

07:016:007 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green
           withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as
           another man.

07:016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven
           green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with
           them.

07:016:009 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
           chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee,
           Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken
           when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.

07:016:010 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
           told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou
           mightest be bound.

07:016:011 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that
           never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another
           man.

07:016:012 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and
           said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there
           were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them
           from off his arms like a thread.

07:016:013 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,
           and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.
           And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my
           head with the web.

07:016:014 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
           Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his
           sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the
           web.

07:016:015 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
           thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three
           times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

07:016:016 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her
           words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;

07:016:017 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath
           not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite
           unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my
           strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like
           any other man.

07:016:018 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
           sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come
           up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the
           lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money
           in their hand.

07:016:019 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a
           man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his
           head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from
           him.

07:016:020 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
           awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other
           times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD
           was departed from him.

07:016:021 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and
           brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
           and he did grind in the prison house.

07:016:022 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
           shaven.

07:016:023 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for
           to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to
           rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our
           enemy into our hand.

07:016:024 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they
           said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
           destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.

07:016:025 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
           said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they
           called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them
           sport: and they set him between the pillars.

07:016:026 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
           me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth,
           that I may lean upon them.

07:016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
           the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about
           three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made
           sport.

07:016:028 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God,
           remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only
           this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
           Philistines for my two eyes.

07:016:029 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
           house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his
           right hand, and of the other with his left.

07:016:030 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
           himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords,
           and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which
           he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his
           life.

07:016:031 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
           and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah
           and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he
           judged Israel twenty years.

07:017:001 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

07:017:002 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of
           silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst,
           and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with
           me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the
           LORD, my son.

07:017:003 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver
           to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the
           silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven
           image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto
           thee.

07:017:004 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took
           two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder,
           who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they
           were in the house of Micah.

07:017:005 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
           teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his
           priest.

07:017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did
           that which was right in his own eyes.

07:017:007 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family
           of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

07:017:008 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
           sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount
           Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

07:017:009 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
           him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn
           where I may find a place.

07:017:010 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a
           father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of
           silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
           So the Levite went in.

07:017:011 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the
           young man was unto him as one of his sons.

07:017:012 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
           priest, and was in the house of Micah.

07:017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
           seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

07:018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days
           the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell
           in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen
           unto them among the tribes of Israel.

07:018:002 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from
           their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to
           spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them,
           Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to
           the house of Micah, they lodged there.

07:018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of
           the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said
           unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in
           this place? and what hast thou here?

07:018:004 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me,
           and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

07:018:005 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God,
           that we may know whether our way which we go shall be
           prosperous.

07:018:006 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is
           your way wherein ye go.

07:018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the
           people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the
           manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no
           magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any
           thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no
           business with any man.

07:018:008 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and
           their brethren said unto them, What say ye?

07:018:009 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we
           have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye
           still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the
           land.

07:018:010 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
           land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where
           there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.

07:018:011 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out
           of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with
           weapons of war.

07:018:012 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:
           wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day:
           behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.

07:018:013 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
           house of Micah.

07:018:014 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
           Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is
           in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image,
           and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.

07:018:015 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the
           young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and
           saluted him.

07:018:016 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
           which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of
           the gate.

07:018:017 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and
           came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and
           the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in
           the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were
           appointed with weapons of war.

07:018:018 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved
           image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then
           said the priest unto them, What do ye?

07:018:019 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon
           thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:
           is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one
           man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in
           Israel?

07:018:020 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and
           the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of
           the people.

07:018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
           cattle and the carriage before them.

07:018:022 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men
           that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered
           together, and overtook the children of Dan.

07:018:023 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
           faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest
           with such a company?

07:018:024 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the
           priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what
           is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?

07:018:025 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be
           heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou
           lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.

07:018:026 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw
           that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back
           unto his house.

07:018:027 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest
           which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at
           quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the
           sword, and burnt the city with fire.

07:018:028 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
           they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley
           that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt
           therein.

07:018:029 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of
           Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name
           of the city was Laish at the first.

07:018:030 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
           the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were
           priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of
           the land.

07:018:031 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all
           the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

07:019:001 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
           Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side
           of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of
           Bethlehemjudah.

07:019:002 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
           from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was
           there four whole months.

07:019:003 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly
           unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him,
           and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's
           house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced
           to meet him.

07:019:004 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and
           he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and
           lodged there.

07:019:005 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early
           in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's
           father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a
           morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.

07:019:006 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them
           together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be
           content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart
           be merry.

07:019:007 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged
           him: therefore he lodged there again.

07:019:008 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;
           and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray
           thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both
           of them.

07:019:009 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
           his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto
           him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you
           tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge
           here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you
           early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

07:019:010 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
           departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and
           there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was
           with him.

07:019:011 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
           servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us
           turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

07:019:012 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither
           into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of
           Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.

07:019:013 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to
           one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in
           Ramah.

07:019:014 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
           upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to
           Benjamin.

07:019:015 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in
           Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of
           the city: for there was no man that took them into his house
           to lodging.

07:019:016 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
           field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he
           sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.

07:019:017 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
           the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest
           thou? and whence comest thou?

07:019:018 And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah
           toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went
           to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the
           LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.

07:019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
           is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for
           the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of
           any thing.

07:019:020 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all
           thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

07:019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
           asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

07:019:022 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
           the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,
           and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house,
           the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine
           house, that we may know him.

07:019:023 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
           said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so
           wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not
           this folly.

07:019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them
           I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them
           what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a
           thing.

07:019:025 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
           concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her,
           and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the
           day began to spring, they let her go.

07:019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down
           at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was
           light.

07:019:027 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
           the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman
           his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and
           her hands were upon the threshold.

07:019:028 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
           answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man
           rose up, and gat him unto his place.

07:019:029 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
           hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her
           bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of
           Israel.

07:019:030 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such
           deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel
           came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of
           it, take advice, and speak your minds.

07:020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
           was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba,
           with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

07:020:002 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of
           Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of
           God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

07:020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of
           Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of
           Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?

07:020:004 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain,
           answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to
           Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

07:020:005 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
           round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me:
           and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.

07:020:006 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
           throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for
           they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

07:020:007 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice
           and counsel.

07:020:008 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any
           of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his
           house.

07:020:009 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we
           will go up by lot against it;

07:020:010 And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the
           tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand
           out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that
           they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according
           to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

07:020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
           together as one man.

07:020:012 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
           Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among
           you?

07:020:013 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial,
           which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put
           away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not
           hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.

07:020:014 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out
           of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the
           children of Israel.

07:020:015 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
           the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside
           the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred
           chosen men.

07:020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
           lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth,
           and not miss.

07:020:017 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
           hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of
           war.

07:020:018 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
           God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go
           up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And
           the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.

07:020:019 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and
           encamped against Gibeah.

07:020:020 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and
           the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against
           them at Gibeah.

07:020:021 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and
           destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty
           and two thousand men.

07:020:022 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and
           set their battle again in array in the place where they put
           themselves in array the first day.

07:020:023 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
           until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go
           up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my
           brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)

07:020:024 And the children of Israel came near against the children of
           Benjamin the second day.

07:020:025 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
           day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of
           Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

07:020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
           and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before
           the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt
           offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

07:020:027 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark
           of the covenant of God was there in those days,

07:020:028 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood
           before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to
           battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
           cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver
           them into thine hand.

07:020:029 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

07:020:030 And the children of Israel went up against the children of
           Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against
           Gibeah, as at other times.

07:020:031 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and
           were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the
           people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which
           one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in
           the field, about thirty men of Israel.

07:020:032 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down
           before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said,
           Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.

07:020:033 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
           themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of
           Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows
           of Gibeah.

07:020:034 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of
           all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that
           evil was near them.

07:020:035 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
           Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five
           thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.

07:020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for
           the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they
           trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside
           Gibeah.

07:020:037 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
           liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city
           with the edge of the sword.

07:020:038 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
           the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with
           smoke rise up out of the city.

07:020:039 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin
           began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty
           persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before
           us, as in the first battle.

07:020:040 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
           pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and,
           behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.

07:020:041 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
           were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

07:020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
           unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them;
           and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the
           midst of them.

07:020:043 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased
           them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward
           the sunrising.

07:020:044 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these
           were men of valour.

07:020:045 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
           of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five
           thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew
           two thousand men of them.

07:020:046 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and
           five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of
           valour.

07:020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
           rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

07:020:048 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
           Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well
           the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to
           hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

07:021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall
           not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

07:021:002 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
           even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;

07:021:003 And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in
           Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in
           Israel?

07:021:004 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,
           and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and
           peace offerings.

07:021:005 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
           tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto
           the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that
           came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be
           put to death.

07:021:006 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
           brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this
           day.

07:021:007 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
           sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters
           to wives?

07:021:008 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that
           came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came
           none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

07:021:009 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of
           the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

07:021:010 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
           valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the
           inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with
           the women and the children.

07:021:011 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly
           destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

07:021:012 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
           hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any
           male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is
           in the land of Canaan.

07:021:013 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children
           of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call
           peaceably unto them.

07:021:014 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
           which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and
           yet so they sufficed them not.

07:021:015 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the
           LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

07:021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
           wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out
           of Benjamin?

07:021:017 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be
           escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of
           Israel.

07:021:018 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
           children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that
           giveth a wife to Benjamin.

07:021:019 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
           yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the
           east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem,
           and on the south of Lebonah.

07:021:020 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
           and lie in wait in the vineyards;

07:021:021 And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to
           dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch
           you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to
           the land of Benjamin.

07:021:022 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come
           unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable
           unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man
           his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this
           time, that ye should be guilty.

07:021:023 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
           according to their number, of them that danced, whom they
           caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and
           repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.

07:021:024 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
           man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from
           thence every man to his inheritance.

07:021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that
           which was right in his own eyes.

Book 08        Ruth

08:001:001 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
           there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
           Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and
           his wife, and his two sons.

08:001:002 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his
           wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
           Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country
           of Moab, and continued there.

08:001:003 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
           two sons.

08:001:004 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the
           one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they
           dwelled there about ten years.

08:001:005 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
           was left of her two sons and her husband.

08:001:006 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
           return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the
           country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in
           giving them bread.

08:001:007 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
           her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to
           return unto the land of Judah.

08:001:008 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each
           to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye
           have dealt with the dead, and with me.

08:001:009 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the
           house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up
           their voice, and wept.

08:001:010 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
           thy people.

08:001:011 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
           me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be
           your husbands?

08:001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to
           have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should
           have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;

08:001:013 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
           for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it
           grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is
           gone out against me.

08:001:014 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
           kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

08:001:015 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
           people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in
           law.

08:001:016 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
           following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
           where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
           people, and thy God my God:

08:001:017 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the
           LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee
           and me.

08:001:018 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,
           then she left speaking unto her.

08:001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
           pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was
           moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

08:001:020 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for
           the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

08:001:021 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
           why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified
           against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

08:001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in
           law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and
           they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

08:002:001 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of
           wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

08:002:002 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
           field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall
           find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

08:002:003 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
           reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
           belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

08:002:004 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
           reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD
           bless thee.

08:002:005 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
           Whose damsel is this?

08:002:006 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and
           said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
           of the country of Moab:

08:002:007 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the
           reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued
           even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in
           the house.

08:002:008 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
           not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but
           abide here fast by my maidens:

08:002:009 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou
           after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
           not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the
           vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.

08:002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
           and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that
           thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

08:002:011 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed
           me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the
           death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and
           thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
           people which thou knewest not heretofore.

08:002:012 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee
           of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to
           trust.

08:002:013 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for
           that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
           friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of
           thine handmaidens.

08:002:014 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat
           of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat
           beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she
           did eat, and was sufficed, and left.

08:002:015 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young
           men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and
           reproach her not:

08:002:016 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
           leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

08:002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she
           had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

08:002:018 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in
           law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave
           to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.

08:002:019 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
           to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
           knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom
           she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought
           to day is Boaz.

08:002:020 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
           LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to
           the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto
           us, one of our next kinsmen.

08:002:021 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
           keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my
           harvest.

08:002:022 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
           daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet
           thee not in any other field.

08:002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end
           of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her
           mother in law.

08:003:001 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall
           I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?

08:003:002 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou
           wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the
           threshingfloor.

08:003:003 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment
           upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not
           thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating
           and drinking.

08:003:004 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
           place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover
           his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
           shalt do.

08:003:005 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

08:003:006 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all
           that her mother in law bade her.

08:003:007 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
           went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came
           softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

08:003:008 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
           turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

08:003:009 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
           handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for
           thou art a near kinsman.

08:003:010 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for
           thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the
           beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether
           poor or rich.

08:003:011 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that
           thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that
           thou art a virtuous woman.

08:003:012 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there
           is a kinsman nearer than I.

08:003:013 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he
           will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do
           the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
           kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,
           as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

08:003:014 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up
           before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be
           known that a woman came into the floor.

08:003:015 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and
           hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of
           barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.

08:003:016 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art
           thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done
           to her.

08:003:017 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
           said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

08:003:018 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
           matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he
           have finished the thing this day.

08:004:001 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
           behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he
           said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
           aside, and sat down.

08:004:002 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit
           ye down here. And they sat down.

08:004:003 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of
           the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our
           brother Elimelech's:

08:004:004 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
           inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
           redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then
           tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it
           beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem
           it.

08:004:005 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
           Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife
           of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
           inheritance.

08:004:006 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I
           mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for
           I cannot redeem it.

08:004:007 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
           redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things;
           a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and
           this was a testimony in Israel.

08:004:008 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he
           drew off his shoe.

08:004:009 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
           witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was
           Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the
           hand of Naomi.

08:004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
           purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon
           his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from
           among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are
           witnesses this day.

08:004:011 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders,
           said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come
           into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did
           build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,
           and be famous in Bethlehem:

08:004:012 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
           unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this
           young woman.

08:004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in
           unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

08:004:014 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
           not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be
           famous in Israel.

08:004:015 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a
           nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which
           loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath
           born him.

08:004:016 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
           nurse unto it.

08:004:017 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is
           a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the
           father of Jesse, the father of David.

08:004:018 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

08:004:019 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

08:004:020 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

08:004:021 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

08:004:022 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

Book 09        1 Samuel

09:001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount
           Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son
           of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

09:001:002 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the
           name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but
           Hannah had no children.

09:001:003 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
           sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons
           of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were
           there.

09:001:004 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to
           Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters,
           portions:

09:001:005 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah:
           but the LORD had shut up her womb.

09:001:006 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her
           fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.

09:001:007 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
           of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did
           not eat.

09:001:008 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest
           thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?
           am not I better to thee than ten sons?

09:001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
           they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post
           of the temple of the LORD.

09:001:010 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD,
           and wept sore.

09:001:011 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
           indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember
           me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine
           handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all
           the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his
           head.

09:001:012 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
           that Eli marked her mouth.

09:001:013 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but
           her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been
           drunken.

09:001:014 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
           thy wine from thee.

09:001:015 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
           sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
           but have poured out my soul before the LORD.

09:001:016 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of
           the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken
           hitherto.

09:001:017 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
           grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

09:001:018 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So
           the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was
           no more sad.

09:001:019 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
           the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and
           Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

09:001:020 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
           Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name
           Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.

09:001:021 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
           the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

09:001:022 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will
           not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring
           him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for
           ever.

09:001:023 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
           good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD
           establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck
           until she weaned him.

09:001:024 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
           three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
           and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the
           child was young.

09:001:025 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

09:001:026 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
           the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

09:001:027 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my
           petition which I asked of him:

09:001:028 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he
           liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the
           LORD there.

09:002:001 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
           mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over
           mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

09:002:002 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
           neither is there any rock like our God.

09:002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
           of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him
           actions are weighed.

09:002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled
           are girded with strength.

09:002:005 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
           they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born
           seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

09:002:006 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the
           grave, and bringeth up.

09:002:007 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
           lifteth up.

09:002:008 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
           beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to
           make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the
           earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.

09:002:009 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
           silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

09:002:010 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
           heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the
           ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king,
           and exalt the horn of his anointed.

09:002:011 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
           minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

09:002:012 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the
           LORD.

09:002:013 And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any
           man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the
           flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his
           hand;

09:002:014 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
           all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.
           So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came
           thither.

09:002:015 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and
           said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the
           priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

09:002:016 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the
           fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth;
           then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now:
           and if not, I will take it by force.

09:002:017 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
           LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

09:002:018 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded
           with a linen ephod.

09:002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to
           him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
           offer the yearly sacrifice.

09:002:020 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
           thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the
           LORD. And they went unto their own home.

09:002:021 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
           three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before
           the LORD.

09:002:022 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
           Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the
           door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

09:002:023 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of
           your evil dealings by all this people.

09:002:024 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make
           the LORD's people to transgress.

09:002:025 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but
           if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?
           Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their
           father, because the LORD would slay them.

09:002:026 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
           LORD, and also with men.

09:002:027 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
           saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy
           father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

09:002:028 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my
           priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an
           ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father
           all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

09:002:029 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which
           I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons
           above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
           offerings of Israel my people?

09:002:030 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy
           house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for
           ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that
           honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be
           lightly esteemed.

09:002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the
           arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man
           in thine house.

09:002:032 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the
           wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an
           old man in thine house for ever.

09:002:033 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine
           altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine
           heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the
           flower of their age.

09:002:034 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy
           two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die
           both of them.

09:002:035 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
           according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I
           will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
           anointed for ever.

09:002:036 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in
           thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver
           and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee,
           into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of
           bread.

09:003:001 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And
           the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no
           open vision.

09:003:002 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in
           his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not
           see;

09:003:003 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,
           where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;

09:003:004 That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.

09:003:005 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst
           me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and
           lay down.

09:003:006 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and
           went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And
           he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.

09:003:007 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of
           the LORD yet revealed unto him.

09:003:008 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
           and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.
           And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.

09:003:009 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be,
           if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy
           servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

09:003:010 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
           Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
           heareth.

09:003:011 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in
           Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it
           shall tingle.

09:003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
           spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an
           end.

09:003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for
           the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made
           themselves vile, and he restrained them not.

09:003:014 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
           iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
           offering for ever.

09:003:015 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
           house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

09:003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
           answered, Here am I.

09:003:017 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto
           thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and
           more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things
           that he said unto thee.

09:003:018 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And
           he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

09:003:019 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none
           of his words fall to the ground.

09:003:020 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
           established to be a prophet of the LORD.

09:003:021 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
           himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

09:004:001 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
           against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside
           Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.

09:004:002 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
           and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the
           Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four
           thousand men.

09:004:003 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
           Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before
           the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it
           may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

09:004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from
           thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which
           dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli,
           Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant
           of God.

09:004:005 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the
           camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
           rang again.

09:004:006 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
           said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp
           of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD
           was come into the camp.

09:004:007 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
           into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not
           been such a thing heretofore.

09:004:008 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these
           mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with
           all the plagues in the wilderness.

09:004:009 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that
           ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you:
           quit yourselves like men, and fight.

09:004:010 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
           fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great
           slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

09:004:011 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
           and Phinehas, were slain.

09:004:012 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
           Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon
           his head.

09:004:013 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
           watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when
           the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried
           out.

09:004:014 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What
           meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily,
           and told Eli.

09:004:015 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
           that he could not see.

09:004:016 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army,
           and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there
           done, my son?

09:004:017 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
           Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among
           the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are
           dead, and the ark of God is taken.

09:004:018 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
           that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the
           gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man,
           and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

09:004:019 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near
           to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark
           of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband
           were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came
           upon her.

09:004:020 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
           said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she
           answered not, neither did she regard it.

09:004:021 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
           from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of
           her father in law and her husband.

09:004:022 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark
           of God is taken.

09:005:001 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
           Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

09:005:002 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into
           the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

09:005:003 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,
           Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of
           the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

09:005:004 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon
           was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the
           LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands
           were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was
           left to him.

09:005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
           Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto
           this day.

09:005:006 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
           destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and
           the coasts thereof.

09:005:007 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The
           ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand
           is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

09:005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the
           Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark
           of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the
           God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the
           ark of the God of Israel about thither.

09:005:009 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand
           of the LORD was against the city with a very great
           destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and
           great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.

09:005:010 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to
           pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites
           cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God
           of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.

09:005:011 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
           Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel,
           and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and
           our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all
           the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.

09:005:012 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and
           the cry of the city went up to heaven.

09:006:001 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
           seven months.

09:006:002 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
           saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us
           wherewith we shall send it to his place.

09:006:003 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel,
           send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass
           offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to
           you why his hand is not removed from you.

09:006:004 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we
           shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and
           five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the
           Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.

09:006:005 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of
           your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the
           God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off
           you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.

09:006:006 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
           Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully
           among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

09:006:007 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on
           which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart,
           and bring their calves home from them:

09:006:008 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and
           put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass
           offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,
           that it may go.

09:006:009 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
           Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not,
           then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it
           was a chance that happened to us.

09:006:010 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to
           the cart, and shut up their calves at home:

09:006:011 And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the
           coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.

09:006:012 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh,
           and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned
           not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of
           the Philistines went after them unto the border of
           Bethshemesh.

09:006:013 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in
           the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark,
           and rejoiced to see it.

09:006:014 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
           stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the
           wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto
           the LORD.

09:006:015 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
           that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put
           them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered
           burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto
           the LORD.

09:006:016 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
           returned to Ekron the same day.

09:006:017 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines
           returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod
           one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron
           one;

09:006:018 And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
           of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced
           cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of
           Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone
           remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the
           Bethshemite.

09:006:019 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked
           into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty
           thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented,
           because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great
           slaughter.

09:006:020 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before
           this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

09:006:021 And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim,
           saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the
           LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.

09:007:001 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of
           the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the
           hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the
           LORD.

09:007:002 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim,
           that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the
           house of Israel lamented after the LORD.

09:007:003 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye
           do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away
           the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare
           your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will
           deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

09:007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
           and served the LORD only.

09:007:005 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray
           for you unto the LORD.

09:007:006 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
           poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and
           said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged
           the children of Israel in Mizpeh.

09:007:007 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel
           were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines
           went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard
           it, they were afraid of the Philistines.

09:007:008 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry
           unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the
           hand of the Philistines.

09:007:009 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
           offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD
           for Israel; and the LORD heard him.

09:007:010 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
           Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD
           thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the
           Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten
           before Israel.

09:007:011 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
           Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

09:007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
           and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the
           LORD helped us.

09:007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into
           the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the
           Philistines all the days of Samuel.

09:007:014 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel
           were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the
           coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the
           Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the
           Amorites.

09:007:015 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

09:007:016 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and
           Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

09:007:017 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and
           there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the
           LORD.

09:008:001 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his
           sons judges over Israel.

09:008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
           second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

09:008:003 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
           lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

09:008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
           and came to Samuel unto Ramah,

09:008:005 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not
           in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the
           nations.

09:008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a
           king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

09:008:007 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
           people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not
           rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not
           reign over them.

09:008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day
           that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day,
           wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do
           they also unto thee.

09:008:009 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
           solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that
           shall reign over them.

09:008:010 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
           asked of him a king.

09:008:011 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall
           reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for
           himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some
           shall run before his chariots.

09:008:012 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
           over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap
           his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
           instruments of his chariots.

09:008:013 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to
           be cooks, and to be bakers.

09:008:014 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
           oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his
           servants.

09:008:015 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your
           vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

09:008:016 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
           your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his
           work.

09:008:017 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
           servants.

09:008:018 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
           shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that
           day.

09:008:019 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;
           and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

09:008:020 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king
           may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

09:008:021 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
           them in the ears of the LORD.

09:008:022 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and
           make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go
           ye every man unto his city.

09:009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son
           of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of
           Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

09:009:002 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and
           a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a
           goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was
           higher than any of the people.

09:009:003 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said
           to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and
           arise, go seek the asses.

09:009:004 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the
           land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed
           through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he
           passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them
           not.

09:009:005 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
           servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my
           father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.

09:009:006 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man
           of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh
           surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can
           shew us our way that we should go.

09:009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what
           shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
           and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what
           have we?

09:009:008 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
           here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will
           I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

09:009:009 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus
           he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now
           called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

09:009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So
           they went unto the city where the man of God was.

09:009:011 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
           maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the
           seer here?

09:009:012 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
           you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there
           is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

09:009:013 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find
           him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people
           will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the
           sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now
           therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

09:009:014 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into
           the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up
           to the high place.

09:009:015 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul
           came, saying,

09:009:016 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the
           land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over
           my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand
           of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because
           their cry is come unto me.

09:009:017 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the
           man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my
           people.

09:009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me,
           I pray thee, where the seer's house is.

09:009:019 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up
           before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to
           day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all
           that is in thine heart.

09:009:020 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not
           thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the
           desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's
           house?

09:009:021 And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the
           smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of
           all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then
           speakest thou so to me?

09:009:022 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
           the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among
           them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.

09:009:023 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
           thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

09:009:024 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
           and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is
           left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it
           been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So
           Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

09:009:025 And when they were come down from the high place into the
           city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

09:009:026 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of
           the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house,
           saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and
           they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

09:009:027 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel
           said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he
           passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee
           the word of God.

09:010:001 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head,
           and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath
           anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

09:010:002 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find
           two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at
           Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou
           wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the
           care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I
           do for my son?

09:010:003 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come
           to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men
           going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and
           another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a
           bottle of wine:

09:010:004 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
           which thou shalt receive of their hands.

09:010:005 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
           garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when
           thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a
           company of prophets coming down from the high place with a
           psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
           and they shall prophesy:

09:010:006 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt
           prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

09:010:007 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou
           do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

09:010:008 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I
           will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to
           sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou
           tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

09:010:009 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
           Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came
           to pass that day.

09:010:010 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
           prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
           prophesied among them.

09:010:011 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw
           that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the
           people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the
           son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?

09:010:012 And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
           father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the
           prophets?

09:010:013 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the
           high place.

09:010:014 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither
           went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that
           they were no where, we came to Samuel.

09:010:015 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
           unto you.

09:010:016 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the
           asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof
           Samuel spake, he told him not.

09:010:017 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

09:010:018 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God
           of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you
           out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
           kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:

09:010:019 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you
           out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have
           said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore
           present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your
           thousands.

09:010:020 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
           near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

09:010:021 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
           families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of
           Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be
           found.

09:010:022 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
           yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid
           himself among the stuff.

09:010:023 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among
           the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
           shoulders and upward.

09:010:024 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD
           hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?
           And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.

09:010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
           wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel
           sent all the people away, every man to his house.

09:010:026 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
           band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

09:010:027 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?
           And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held
           his peace.

09:011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
           Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make
           a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

09:011:002 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will
           I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your
           right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.

09:011:003 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
           respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of
           Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come
           out to thee.

09:011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the
           tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted
           up their voices, and wept.

09:011:005 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and
           Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they
           told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.

09:011:006 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those
           tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.

09:011:007 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
           them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of
           messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and
           after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear
           of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one
           consent.

09:011:008 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel
           were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty
           thousand.

09:011:009 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
           unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun
           be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed
           it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.

09:011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
           unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto
           you.

09:011:011 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
           companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the
           morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the
           day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were
           scattered, so that two of them were not left together.

09:011:012 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall
           Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to
           death.

09:011:013 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:
           for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

09:011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
           and renew the kingdom there.

09:011:015 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul
           king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed
           sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul
           and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

09:012:001 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
           your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king
           over you.

09:012:002 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
           grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have
           walked before you from my childhood unto this day.

09:012:003 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and
           before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have
           I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or
           of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes
           therewith? and I will restore it you.

09:012:004 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
           neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

09:012:005 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and
           his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought
           in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.

09:012:006 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
           Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the
           land of Egypt.

09:012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before
           the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did
           to you and to your fathers.

09:012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto
           the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought
           forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this
           place.

09:012:009 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
           hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the
           hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of
           Moab, and they fought against them.

09:012:010 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned,
           because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and
           Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies,
           and we will serve thee.

09:012:011 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
           Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on
           every side, and ye dwelled safe.

09:012:012 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
           came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign
           over us: when the LORD your God was your king.

09:012:013 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
           have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

09:012:014 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice,
           and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall
           both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue
           following the LORD your God:
