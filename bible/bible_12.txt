           beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald,
           and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets
           and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou
           wast created.

26:028:014 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set
           thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast
           walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

26:028:015 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
           created, till iniquity was found in thee.

26:028:016 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst
           of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will
           cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will
           destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones
           of fire.

26:028:017 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
           corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast
           thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they
           may behold thee.

26:028:018 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
           iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I
           bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour
           thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the
           sight of all them that behold thee.

26:028:019 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished
           at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any
           more.

26:028:020 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:028:021 Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against
           it,

26:028:022 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
           Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they
           shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed
           judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.

26:028:023 For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her
           streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her
           by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that
           I am the LORD.

26:028:024 And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of
           Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about
           them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the
           Lord GOD.

26:028:025 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house
           of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and
           shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then
           shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant
           Jacob.

26:028:026 And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses,
           and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence,
           when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise
           them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD
           their God.

26:029:001 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of
           the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:029:002 Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
           prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:

26:029:003 Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against
           thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in
           the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine
           own, and I have made it for myself.

26:029:004 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of
           thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up
           out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers
           shall stick unto thy scales.

26:029:005 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all
           the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields;
           thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given
           thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of
           the heaven.

26:029:006 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the
           LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of
           Israel.

26:029:007 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and
           rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou
           brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.

26:029:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a
           sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.

26:029:009 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they
           shall know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river
           is mine, and I have made it.

26:029:010 Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers,
           and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate,
           from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

26:029:011 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall
           pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.

26:029:012 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
           countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities
           that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will
           scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse
           them through the countries.

26:029:013 Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I
           gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were
           scattered:

26:029:014 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause
           them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of
           their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.

26:029:015 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt
           itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them,
           that they shall no more rule over the nations.

26:029:016 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,
           which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall
           look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

26:029:017 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the
           first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the
           LORD came unto me, saying,

26:029:018 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to
           serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald,
           and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his
           army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against
           it:

26:029:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the
           land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he
           shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her
           prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.

26:029:020 I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he
           served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord
           GOD.

26:029:021 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to
           bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in
           the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

26:030:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

26:030:002 Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl
           ye, Woe worth the day!

26:030:003 For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a
           cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.

26:030:004 And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be
           in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they
           shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be
           broken down.

26:030:005 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people,
           and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall
           fall with them by the sword.

26:030:006 Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall;
           and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of
           Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.

26:030:007 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that
           are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the
           cities that are wasted.

26:030:008 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire
           in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.

26:030:009 In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make
           the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon
           them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.

26:030:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of
           Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.

26:030:011 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall
           be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their
           swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

26:030:012 And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the
           hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all
           that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have
           spoken it.

26:030:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I
           will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall
           be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a
           fear in the land of Egypt.

26:030:014 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan,
           and will execute judgments in No.

26:030:015 And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I
           will cut off the multitude of No.

26:030:016 And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and
           No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses
           daily.

26:030:017 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword:
           and these cities shall go into captivity.

26:030:018 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall
           break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength
           shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and
           her daughters shall go into captivity.

26:030:019 Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know
           that I am the LORD.

26:030:020 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month,
           in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD
           came unto me, saying,

26:030:021 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
           and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a
           roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.

26:030:022 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against
           Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong,
           and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall
           out of his hand.

26:030:023 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
           disperse them through the countries.

26:030:024 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put
           my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he
           shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded
           man.

26:030:025 But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the
           arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am
           the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king
           of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of
           Egypt.

26:030:026 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and
           disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I
           am the LORD.

26:031:001 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month,
           in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came
           unto me, saying,

26:031:002 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his
           multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?

26:031:003 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair
           branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature;
           and his top was among the thick boughs.

26:031:004 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with
           her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little
           rivers unto all the trees of the field.

26:031:005 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
           field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became
           long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.

26:031:006 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and
           under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth
           their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.

26:031:007 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his
           branches: for his root was by great waters.

26:031:008 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir
           trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were
           not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was
           like unto him in his beauty.

26:031:009 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that
           all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied
           him.

26:031:010 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
           thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick
           boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;

26:031:011 I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one
           of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven
           him out for his wickedness.

26:031:012 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
           and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys
           his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the
           rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone
           down from his shadow, and have left him.

26:031:013 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and
           all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:

26:031:014 To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt
           themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among
           the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their
           height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto
           death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the
           children of men, with them that go down to the pit.

26:031:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the
           grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I
           restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were
           stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the
           trees of the field fainted for him.

26:031:016 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
           cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and
           all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all
           that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of
           the earth.

26:031:017 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
           with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under
           his shadow in the midst of the heathen.

26:031:018 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
           trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees
           of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in
           the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the
           sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord
           GOD.

26:032:001 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month,
           in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came
           unto me, saying,

26:032:002 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt,
           and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations,
           and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth
           with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and
           fouledst their rivers.

26:032:003 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net
           over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring
           thee up in my net.

26:032:004 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth
           upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the
           heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the
           whole earth with thee.

26:032:005 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the
           valleys with thy height.

26:032:006 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou
           swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full
           of thee.

26:032:007 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and
           make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a
           cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.

26:032:008 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee,
           and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.

26:032:009 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring
           thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which
           thou hast not known.

26:032:010 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings
           shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my
           sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment,
           every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.

26:032:011 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon
           shall come upon thee.

26:032:012 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to
           fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall
           spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall
           be destroyed.

26:032:013 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the
           great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any
           more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.

26:032:014 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to
           run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.

26:032:015 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country
           shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall
           smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I
           am the LORD.

26:032:016 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the
           daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament
           for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the
           Lord GOD.

26:032:017 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
           of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:032:018 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them
           down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto
           the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the
           pit.

26:032:019 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with
           the uncircumcised.

26:032:020 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the
           sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her
           multitudes.

26:032:021 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the
           midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down,
           they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

26:032:022 Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him:
           all of them slain, fallen by the sword:

26:032:023 Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company
           is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the
           sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.

26:032:024 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all
           of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down
           uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused
           their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne
           their shame with them that go down to the pit.

26:032:025 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
           multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them
           uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was
           caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their
           shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the
           midst of them that be slain.

26:032:026 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are
           round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the
           sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the
           living.

26:032:027 And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
           uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons
           of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but
           their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were
           the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

26:032:028 Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,
           and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.

26:032:029 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with
           their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword:
           they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go
           down to the pit.

26:032:030 There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
           Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their
           terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie
           uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear
           their shame with them that go down to the pit.

26:032:031 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
           multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword,
           saith the Lord GOD.

26:032:032 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he
           shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that
           are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude,
           saith the Lord GOD.

26:033:001 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:033:002 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto
           them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the
           land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their
           watchman:

26:033:003 If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
           trumpet, and warn the people;

26:033:004 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh
           not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood
           shall be upon his own head.

26:033:005 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
           blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall
           deliver his soul.

26:033:006 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the
           trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and
           take any person from among them, he is taken away in his
           iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.

26:033:007 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the
           house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my
           mouth, and warn them from me.

26:033:008 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely
           die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way,
           that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will
           I require at thine hand.

26:033:009 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from
           it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his
           iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

26:033:010 Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;
           Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be
           upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?

26:033:011 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no
           pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn
           from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways;
           for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

26:033:012 Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy
           people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver
           him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of
           the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he
           turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be
           able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.

26:033:013 When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live;
           if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all
           his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his
           iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.

26:033:014 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if
           he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;

26:033:015 If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had
           robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing
           iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.

26:033:016 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned
           unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he
           shall surely live.

26:033:017 Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not
           equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.

26:033:018 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and
           committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.

26:033:019 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which
           is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.

26:033:020 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of
           Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.

26:033:021 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in
           the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that
           had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is
           smitten.

26:033:022 Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he
           that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came
           to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no
           more dumb.

26:033:023 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:033:024 Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of
           Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the
           land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.

26:033:025 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with
           the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed
           blood: and shall ye possess the land?

26:033:026 Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile
           every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?

26:033:027 Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live,
           surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword,
           and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to
           be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves
           shall die of the pestilence.

26:033:028 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her
           strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be
           desolate, that none shall pass through.

26:033:029 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the
           land most desolate because of all their abominations which
           they have committed.

26:033:030 Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are
           talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the
           houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother,
           saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that
           cometh forth from the LORD.

26:033:031 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit
           before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they
           will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love,
           but their heart goeth after their covetousness.

26:033:032 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that
           hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for
           they hear thy words, but they do them not.

26:033:033 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall
           they know that a prophet hath been among them.

26:034:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:034:002 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,
           prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the
           shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed
           themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

26:034:003 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them
           that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.

26:034:004 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
           that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was
           broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven
           away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with
           force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.

26:034:005 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and
           they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they
           were scattered.

26:034:006 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every
           high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of
           the earth, and none did search or seek after them.

26:034:007 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

26:034:008 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became
           a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field,
           because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search
           for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my
           flock;

26:034:009 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

26:034:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds;
           and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to
           cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed
           themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their
           mouth, that they may not be meat for them.

26:034:011 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both
           search my sheep, and seek them out.

26:034:012 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is
           among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my
           sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have
           been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

26:034:013 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them
           from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and
           feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in
           all the inhabited places of the country.

26:034:014 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high
           mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie
           in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the
           mountains of Israel.

26:034:015 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
           the Lord GOD.

26:034:016 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which
           was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and
           will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the
           fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.

26:034:017 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
           judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he
           goats.

26:034:018 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
           pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of
           your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye
           must foul the residue with your feet?

26:034:019 And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with
           your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your
           feet.

26:034:020 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even
           I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean
           cattle.

26:034:021 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed
           all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them
           abroad;

26:034:022 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a
           prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.

26:034:023 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed
           them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall
           be their shepherd.

26:034:024 And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a
           prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.

26:034:025 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
           the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell
           safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

26:034:026 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a
           blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his
           season; there shall be showers of blessing.

26:034:027 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth
           shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their
           land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken
           the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of
           those that served themselves of them.

26:034:028 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall
           the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell
           safely, and none shall make them afraid.

26:034:029 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall
           be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the
           shame of the heathen any more.

26:034:030 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them,
           and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith
           the Lord GOD.

26:034:031 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am
           your God, saith the Lord GOD.

26:035:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:035:002 Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy
           against it,

26:035:003 And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount
           Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand
           against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.

26:035:004 I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and
           thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

26:035:005 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the
           blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in
           the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity
           had an end:

26:035:006 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee
           unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not
           hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.

26:035:007 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it
           him that passeth out and him that returneth.

26:035:008 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy
           hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they
           fall that are slain with the sword.

26:035:009 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall
           not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

26:035:010 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two
           countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the
           LORD was there:

26:035:011 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do
           according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which
           thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make
           myself known among them, when I have judged thee.

26:035:012 And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard
           all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the
           mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are
           given us to consume.

26:035:013 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have
           multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.

26:035:014 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I
           will make thee desolate.

26:035:015 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of
           Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou
           shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of
           it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

26:036:001 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,
           and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:

26:036:002 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against
           you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:

26:036:003 Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because
           they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every
           side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the
           heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are
           an infamy of the people:

26:036:004 Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
           GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the
           hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate
           wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a
           prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round
           about;

26:036:005 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my
           jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and
           against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their
           possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful
           minds, to cast it out for a prey.

26:036:006 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto
           the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the
           valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my
           jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of
           the heathen:

26:036:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand,
           Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their
           shame.

26:036:008 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your
           branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for
           they are at hand to come.

26:036:009 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye
           shall be tilled and sown:

26:036:010 And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel,
           even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the
           wastes shall be builded:

26:036:011 And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall
           increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old
           estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings:
           and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

26:036:012 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel;
           and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their
           inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of
           men.

26:036:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land
           devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations:

26:036:014 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy
           nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.

26:036:015 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
           heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the
           people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall
           any more, saith the Lord GOD.

26:036:016 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:036:017 Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land,
           they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their
           way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.

26:036:018 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they
           had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had
           polluted it:

26:036:019 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were
           dispersed through the countries: according to their way and
           according to their doings I judged them.

26:036:020 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went,
           they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are
           the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.

26:036:021 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel
           had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.

26:036:022 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord
           GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for
           mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the
           heathen, whither ye went.

26:036:023 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among
           the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and
           the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD,
           when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.

26:036:024 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out
           of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

26:036:025 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
           clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will
           I cleanse you.

26:036:026 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
           within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your
           flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.

26:036:027 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
           my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.

26:036:028 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;
           and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

26:036:029 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
           call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine
           upon you.

26:036:030 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of
           the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine
           among the heathen.

26:036:031 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings
           that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own
           sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.

26:036:032 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known
           unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house
           of Israel.

26:036:033 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed
           you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in
           the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.

26:036:034 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
           in the sight of all that passed by.

26:036:035 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
           the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined
           cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.

26:036:036 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that
           I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was
           desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.

26:036:037 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by
           the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them
           with men like a flock.

26:036:038 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
           feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of
           men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

26:037:001 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
           spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley
           which was full of bones,

26:037:002 And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there
           were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very
           dry.

26:037:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
           answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.

26:037:004 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
           them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

26:037:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause
           breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:

26:037:006 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon
           you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye
           shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

26:037:007 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there
           was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came
           together, bone to his bone.

26:037:008 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
           them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath
           in them.

26:037:009 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of
           man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from
           the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that
           they may live.

26:037:010 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
           them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an
           exceeding great army.

26:037:011 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
           house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and
           our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.

26:037:012 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
           Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to
           come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of
           Israel.

26:037:013 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
           graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,

26:037:014 And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall
           place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD
           have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.

26:037:015 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

26:037:016 Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon
           it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions:
           then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the
           stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his
           companions:

26:037:017 And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall
           become one in thine hand.

26:037:018 And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,
           saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?

26:037:019 Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take
           the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the
           tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even
           with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they
           shall be one in mine hand.

26:037:020 And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
           before their eyes.

26:037:021 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
           take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither
           they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring
           them into their own land:

26:037:022 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains
           of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they
           shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided
           into two kingdoms any more at all.

26:037:023 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their
           idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their
           transgressions: but I will save them out of all their
           dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse
           them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.

26:037:024 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all
           shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments,
           and observe my statutes, and do them.

26:037:025 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob
           my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall
           dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their
           children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be
           their prince for ever.

26:037:026 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall
           be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them,
           and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of
           them for evermore.

26:037:027 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their
           God, and they shall be my people.

26:037:028 And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,
           when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

26:038:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:038:002 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the
           chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

26:038:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
           Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

26:038:004 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I
           will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and
           horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a
           great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling
           swords:

26:038:005 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield
           and helmet:

26:038:006 Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north
           quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.

26:038:007 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy
           company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto
           them.

26:038:008 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years
           thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the
           sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the
           mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is
           brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely
           all of them.

26:038:009 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a
           cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many
           people with thee.

26:038:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at
           the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt
           think an evil thought:

26:038:011 And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled
           villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell
           safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither
           bars nor gates,

26:038:012 To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon
           the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the
           people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten
           cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.

26:038:013 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the
           young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to
           take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey?
           to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods,
           to take a great spoil?

26:038:014 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith
           the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth
           safely, shalt thou not know it?

26:038:015 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts,
           thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon
           horses, a great company, and a mighty army:

26:038:016 And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud
           to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will
           bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when
           I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.

26:038:017 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in
           old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which
           prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee
           against them?

26:038:018 And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come
           against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury
           shall come up in my face.

26:038:019 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
           Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land
           of Israel;

26:038:020 So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven,
           and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that
           creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face
           of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains
           shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and
           every wall shall fall to the ground.

26:038:021 And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my
           mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be
           against his brother.

26:038:022 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood;
           and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the
           many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great
           hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

26:038:023 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be
           known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I
           am the LORD.

26:039:001 Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say,
           Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the
           chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

26:039:002 And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of
           thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and
           will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:

26:039:003 And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause
           thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

26:039:004 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all
           thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee
           unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of
           the field to be devoured.

26:039:005 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it,
           saith the Lord GOD.

26:039:006 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
           carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the
           LORD.

26:039:007 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
           Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more:
           and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in
           Israel.

26:039:008 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this
           is the day whereof I have spoken.

26:039:009 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,
           and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields
           and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves,
           and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven
           years:

26:039:010 So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut
           down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons
           with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and
           rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.

26:039:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto
           Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the
           passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses
           of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his
           multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.

26:039:012 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,
           that they may cleanse the land.

26:039:013 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall
           be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith
           the Lord GOD.

26:039:014 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing
           through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain
           upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of
           seven months shall they search.

26:039:015 And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth
           a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the
           buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.

26:039:016 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall
           they cleanse the land.

26:039:017 And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto
           every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field,
           Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side
           to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great
           sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh,
           and drink blood.

26:039:018 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of
           the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of
           bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

26:039:019 And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye
           be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

26:039:020 Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
           with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.

26:039:021 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen
           shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I
           have laid upon them.

26:039:022 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God
           from that day and forward.

26:039:023 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into
           captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against
           me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the
           hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.

26:039:024 According to their uncleanness and according to their
           transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from
           them.

26:039:025 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the
           captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of
           Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;

26:039:026 After that they have borne their shame, and all their
           trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they
           dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.

26:039:027 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered
           them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in
           the sight of many nations;

26:039:028 Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which
           caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I
           have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of
           them any more there.

26:039:029 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have
           poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord
           GOD.

26:040:001 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the
           beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the
           fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the
           selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me
           thither.

26:040:002 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,
           and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the
           frame of a city on the south.

26:040:003 And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose
           appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of
           flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the
           gate.

26:040:004 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes,
           and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I
           shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto
           thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to
           the house of Israel.

26:040:005 And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and
           in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the
           cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the
           building, one reed; and the height, one reed.

26:040:006 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and
           went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the
           gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the
           gate, which was one reed broad.

26:040:007 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed
           broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and
           the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was
           one reed.

26:040:008 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

26:040:009 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
           posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was
           inward.

26:040:010 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on
           this side, and three on that side; they three were of one
           measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on
           that side.

26:040:011 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten
           cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

26:040:012 The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on
           this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the
           little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits
           on that side.

26:040:013 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber
           to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty
           cubits, door against door.

26:040:014 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of
           the court round about the gate.

26:040:015 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of
           the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.

26:040:016 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to
           their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the
           arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each
           post were palm trees.

26:040:017 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were
           chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about:
           thirty chambers were upon the pavement.

26:040:018 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the
           length of the gates was the lower pavement.

26:040:019 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower
           gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred
           cubits eastward and northward.

26:040:020 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the
           north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth
           thereof.

26:040:021 And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and
           three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches
           thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length
           thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty
           cubits.

26:040:022 And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,
           were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the
           east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches
           thereof were before them.

26:040:023 And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate
           toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from
           gate to gate an hundred cubits.

26:040:024 After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
           toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the
           arches thereof according to these measures.

26:040:025 And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round
           about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and
           the breadth five and twenty cubits.

26:040:026 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches
           thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this
           side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.

26:040:027 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and
           he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred
           cubits.

26:040:028 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
           measured the south gate according to these measures;

26:040:029 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and
           the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there
           were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it
           was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

26:040:030 And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long,
           and five cubits broad.

26:040:031 And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
           trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had
           eight steps.

26:040:032 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he
           measured the gate according to these measures.

26:040:033 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and
           the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and
           there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round
           about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits
           broad.

26:040:034 And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm
           trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that
           side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

26:040:035 And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according
           to these measures;

26:040:036 The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches
           thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was
           fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

26:040:037 And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
           trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that
           side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

26:040:038 And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of
           the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.

26:040:039 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and
           two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering
           and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

26:040:040 And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the
           north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was
           at the porch of the gate, were two tables.

26:040:041 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side,
           by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew
           their sacrifices.

26:040:042 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering,
           of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad,
           and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments
           wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

26:040:043 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about:
           and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.

26:040:044 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in
           the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and
           their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the
           east gate having the prospect toward the north.

26:040:045 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward
           the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of
           the house.

26:040:046 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
           priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the
           sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the
           LORD to minister unto him.

26:040:047 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an
           hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was
           before the house.

26:040:048 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each
           post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits
           on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on
           this side, and three cubits on that side.

26:040:049 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth
           eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they
           went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on
           this side, and another on that side.

26:041:001 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,
           six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the
           other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.

26:041:002 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of
           the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on
           the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty
           cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.

26:041:003 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
           cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door,
           seven cubits.

26:041:004 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the
           breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto
           me, This is the most holy place.

26:041:005 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
           breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the
           house on every side.

26:041:006 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty
           in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the
           house for the side chambers round about, that they might have
           hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.

26:041:007 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward
           to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went
           still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of
           the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest
           chamber to the highest by the midst.

26:041:008 I saw also the height of the house round about: the
           foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great
           cubits.

26:041:009 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber
           without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the
           place of the side chambers that were within.

26:041:010 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits
           round about the house on every side.

26:041:011 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that
           was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward
           the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five
           cubits round about.

26:041:012 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
           toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the
           building was five cubits thick round about, and the length
           thereof ninety cubits.

26:041:013 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the
           separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an
           hundred cubits long;

26:041:014 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate
           place toward the east, an hundred cubits.

26:041:015 And he measured the length of the building over against the
           separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof
           on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with
           the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

26:041:016 The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries
           round about on their three stories, over against the door,
           cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the
           windows, and the windows were covered;

26:041:017 To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and
           without, and by all the wall round about within and without,
           by measure.

26:041:018 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm
           tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had
           two faces;

26:041:019 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one
           side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the
           other side: it was made through all the house round about.

26:041:020 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm
           trees made, and on the wall of the temple.

26:041:021 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the
           sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the
           other.

26:041:022 The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length
           thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length
           thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto
           me, This is the table that is before the LORD.

26:041:023 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

26:041:024 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two
           leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.

26:041:025 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
           cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls;
           and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch
           without.

26:041:026 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side
           and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the
           side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

26:042:001 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward
           the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over
           against the separate place, and which was before the building
           toward the north.

26:042:002 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and
           the breadth was fifty cubits.

26:042:003 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,
           and over against the pavement which was for the utter court,
           was gallery against gallery in three stories.

26:042:004 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth
           inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.

26:042:005 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were
           higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of
           the building.

26:042:006 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the
           pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened
           more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

26:042:007 And the wall that was without over against the chambers,
           toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the
           length thereof was fifty cubits.

26:042:008 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court
           was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred
           cubits.

26:042:009 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side,
           as one goeth into them from the utter court.

26:042:010 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
           toward the east, over against the separate place, and over
           against the building.

26:042:011 And the way before them was like the appearance of the
           chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as
           broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to
           their fashions, and according to their doors.

26:042:012 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward
           the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way
           directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into
           them.

26:042:013 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south
           chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy
           chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall
           eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy
           things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the
           trespass offering; for the place is holy.

26:042:014 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of
           the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay
           their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and
           shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those
           things which are for the people.

26:042:015 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he
           brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the
           east, and measured it round about.

26:042:016 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five
           hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

26:042:017 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the
           measuring reed round about.

26:042:018 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the
           measuring reed.

26:042:019 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred
           reeds with the measuring reed.

26:042:020 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,
           five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a
           separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.

26:043:001 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that
           looketh toward the east:

26:043:002 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way
           of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters:
           and the earth shined with his glory.

26:043:003 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I
           saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to
           destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I
           saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

26:043:004 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of
           the gate whose prospect is toward the east.

26:043:005 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
           and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.

26:043:006 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man
           stood by me.

26:043:007 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and
           the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the
           midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name,
           shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor
           their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their
           kings in their high places.

26:043:008 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and
           their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they
           have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they
           have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.

26:043:009 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of
           their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of
           them for ever.

26:043:010 Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that
           they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure
           the pattern.

26:043:011 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them
           the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings
           out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms
           thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms
           thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their
           sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the
           ordinances thereof, and do them.

26:043:012 This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the
           whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold,
           this is the law of the house.

26:043:013 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The
           cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be
           a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by
           the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall
           be the higher place of the altar.

26:043:014 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle
           shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the
           lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits,
           and the breadth one cubit.

26:043:015 So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and
           upward shall be four horns.

26:043:016 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad,
           square in the four squares thereof.

26:043:017 And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen
           broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it
           shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit
           about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.

26:043:018 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD;
           These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they
           shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to
           sprinkle blood thereon.

26:043:019 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the
           seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me,
           saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.

26:043:020 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the
           four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and
           upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge
           it.

26:043:021 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he
           shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the
           sanctuary.

26:043:022 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
           without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the
           altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.

26:043:023 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a
           young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock
           without blemish.

26:043:024 And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests
           shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a
           burnt offering unto the LORD.

26:043:025 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin
           offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram
           out of the flock, without blemish.

26:043:026 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they
           shall consecrate themselves.

26:043:027 And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the
           eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt
           offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will
           accept you, saith the Lord GOD.

26:044:001 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
           sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.

26:044:002 Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall
           not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the
           LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it
           shall be shut.

26:044:003 It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat
           bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch
           of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.

26:044:004 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
           and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the
           house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.

26:044:005 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold
           with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto
           thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD,
           and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the
           house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.

26:044:006 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of
           Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it
           suffice you of all your abominations,

26:044:007 In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers,
           uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in
           my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my
           bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant
           because of all your abominations.

26:044:008 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye
           have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

26:044:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart,
           nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of
           any stranger that is among the children of Israel.

26:044:010 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel
           went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols;
           they shall even bear their iniquity.

26:044:011 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
           the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they
           shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the
           people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto
           them.

26:044:012 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and
           caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore
           have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD,
           and they shall bear their iniquity.

26:044:013 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a
           priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in
           the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and
           their abominations which they have committed.

26:044:014 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for
           all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done
           therein.

26:044:015 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the
           charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray
           from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and
           they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the
           blood, saith the Lord GOD:

26:044:016 They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near
           to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my
           charge.

26:044:017 And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the
           gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen
           garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they
           minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

26:044:018 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have
           linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird
           themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.

26:044:019 And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the
           utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments
           wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers,
           and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not
           sanctify the people with their garments.

26:044:020 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks
           to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.

26:044:021 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the
           inner court.

26:044:022 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that
           is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the
           house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.

26:044:023 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
           and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and
           the clean.

26:044:024 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they
           shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep
           my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall
           hallow my sabbaths.

26:044:025 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves:
           but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter,
           for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may
           defile themselves.

26:044:026 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven
           days.

26:044:027 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the
           inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his
           sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.

26:044:028 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their
           inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I
           am their possession.

26:044:029 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and
           the trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel
           shall be theirs.

26:044:030 And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every
           oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the
           priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your
           dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.

26:044:031 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,
           or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

26:045:001 Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for
           inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy
           portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five
           and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten
           thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round
           about.

26:045:002 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in
           length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and
           fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.

26:045:003 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
           twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it
           shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.

26:045:004 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
           ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister
           unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and
           an holy place for the sanctuary.

26:045:005 And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten
           thousand of breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of
           the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty
           chambers.

26:045:006 And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
           broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the
           oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house
           of Israel.

26:045:007 And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on
           the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the
           possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy
           portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west
           side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length
           shall be over against one of the portions, from the west
           border unto the east border.

26:045:008 In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes
           shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land
           shall they give to the house of Israel according to their
           tribes.

26:045:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of
           Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and
           justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the
           Lord GOD.

26:045:010 Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just
           bath.

26:045:011 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath
           may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the
           tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the
           homer.

26:045:012 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five
           and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

26:045:013 This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an
           ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part
           of an ephah of an homer of barley:

26:045:014 Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall
           offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an
           homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:

26:045:015 And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the
           fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt
           offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for
           them, saith the Lord GOD.

26:045:016 All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the
           prince in Israel.

26:045:017 And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and
           meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the
           new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the
           house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the
           meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace
           offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

26:045:018 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day
           of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish,
           and cleanse the sanctuary:

26:045:019 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,
           and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four
           corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the
           gate of the inner court.

26:045:020 And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every
           one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye
           reconcile the house.

26:045:021 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye
           shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened
           bread shall be eaten.

26:045:022 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for
           all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.

26:045:023 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering
           to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish
           daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin
           offering.

26:045:024 And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a
           bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an
           ephah.

26:045:025 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall
           he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to
           the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and
           according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.

26:046:001 Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that
           looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days;
           but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the
           new moon it shall be opened.

26:046:002 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that
           gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the
           priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace
           offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate:
           then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until
           the evening.

26:046:003 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of
           this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new
           moons.

26:046:004 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the
           LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish,
           and a ram without blemish.

26:046:005 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the
           meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and
           an hin of oil to an ephah.

26:046:006 And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock
           without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be
           without blemish.

26:046:007 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock,
           and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his
           hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

26:046:008 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of
           the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way
           thereof.

26:046:009 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in
           the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north
           gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and
           he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth
           by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way
           of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over
           against it.

26:046:010 And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go
           in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.

26:046:011 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering
           shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to
           the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an
           ephah.

26:046:012 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering
           or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then
           open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall
           prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did
           on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his
           going forth one shall shut the gate.

26:046:013 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a
           lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it
           every morning.

26:046:014 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning,
           the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of
           oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering
           continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.

26:046:015 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and
           the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.

26:046:016 Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of
           his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall
           be their possession by inheritance.

26:046:017 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his
           servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after
           it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be
           his sons' for them.

26:046:018 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance
           by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he
           shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession:
           that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.

26:046:019 After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side
           of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which
           looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the
           two sides westward.

26:046:020 Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests
           shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where
           they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out
           into the utter court, to sanctify the people.

26:046:021 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me
           to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in
           every corner of the court there was a court.

26:046:022 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of
           forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of
           one measure.

26:046:023 And there was a row of building round about in them, round
           about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the
           rows round about.

26:046:024 Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil,
           where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of
           the people.

26:047:001 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and,
           behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the
           house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward
           the east, and the waters came down from under from the right
           side of the house, at the south side of the altar.

26:047:002 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and
           led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way
           that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on
           the right side.

26:047:003 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth
           eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me
           through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.

26:047:004 Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the
           waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a
           thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the
           loins.

26:047:005 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I
           could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim
           in, a river that could not be passed over.

26:047:006 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he
           brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

26:047:007 Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were
           very many trees on the one side and on the other.

26:047:008 Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east
           country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea:
           which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be
           healed.

26:047:009 And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which
           moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and
           there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these
           waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every
           thing shall live whither the river cometh.

26:047:010 And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon
           it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to
           spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their
           kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.

26:047:011 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not
           be healed; they shall be given to salt.

26:047:012 And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on
           that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not
           fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall
           bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their
           waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof
           shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.

26:047:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye
           shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of
           Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.

26:047:014 And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning
           the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers:
           and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.

26:047:015 And this shall be the border of the land toward the north
           side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to
           Zedad;

26:047:016 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of
           Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by
           the coast of Hauran.

26:047:017 And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of
           Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath.
           And this is the north side.

26:047:018 And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from
           Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by
           Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the
           east side.

26:047:019 And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of
           strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the
           south side southward.

26:047:020 The west side also shall be the great sea from the border,
           till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.

26:047:021 So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes
           of Israel.

26:047:022 And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for
           an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn
           among you, which shall beget children among you: and they
           shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of
           Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes
           of Israel.

26:047:023 And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger
           sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the
           Lord GOD.

26:048:001 Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to
           the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath,
           Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of
           Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for
           Dan.

26:048:002 And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west
           side, a portion for Asher.

26:048:003 And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the
           west side, a portion for Naphtali.

26:048:004 And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the
           west side, a portion for Manasseh.

26:048:005 And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the
           west side, a portion for Ephraim.

26:048:006 And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the
           west side, a portion for Reuben.

26:048:007 And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west
           side, a portion for Judah.

26:048:008 And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west
           side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and
           twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the
           other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the
           sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.

26:048:009 The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of
           five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in
           breadth.

26:048:010 And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy
           oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length,
           and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the
           east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and
           twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall
           be in the midst thereof.

26:048:011 It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of
           Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when
           the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went
           astray.

26:048:012 And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto
           them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.

26:048:013 And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall
           have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in
           breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and
           the breadth ten thousand.

26:048:014 And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate
           the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD.

26:048:015 And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over
           against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place
           for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city
           shall be in the midst thereof.

26:048:016 And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four
           thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand
           and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five
           hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.

26:048:017 And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two
           hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty,
           and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west
           two hundred and fifty.

26:048:018 And the residue in length over against the oblation of the
           holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand
           westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the
           holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto
           them that serve the city.

26:048:019 And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the
           tribes of Israel.

26:048:020 All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and
           twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare,
           with the possession of the city.

26:048:021 And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and
           on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of
           the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the
           oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the
           five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against
           the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy
           oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst
           thereof.

26:048:022 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the
           possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is
           the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of
           Benjamin, shall be for the prince.

26:048:023 As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the
           west side, Benjamin shall have a portion.

26:048:024 And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the
           west side, Simeon shall have a portion.

26:048:025 And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west
           side, Issachar a portion.

26:048:026 And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the
           west side, Zebulun a portion.

26:048:027 And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west
           side, Gad a portion.

26:048:028 And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the
           border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in
           Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.

26:048:029 This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes
           of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith
           the Lord GOD.

26:048:030 And these are the goings out of the city on the north side,
           four thousand and five hundred measures.

26:048:031 And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the
           tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben,
           one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.

26:048:032 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three
           gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate
           of Dan.

26:048:033 And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures:
           and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one
           gate of Zebulun.

26:048:034 At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their
           three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of
           Naphtali.

26:048:035 It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of
           the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.

Book 27        Daniel

27:001:001 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
           Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged
           it.

27:001:002 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with
           part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into
           the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the
           vessels into the treasure house of his god.

27:001:003 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
           that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of
           the king's seed, and of the princes;

27:001:004 Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and
           skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and
           understanding science, and such as had ability in them to
           stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the
           learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.

27:001:005 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's
           meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three
           years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the
           king.

27:001:006 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel,
           Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:

27:001:007 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave
           unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of
           Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of
           Abednego.

27:001:008 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile
           himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine
           which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the
           eunuchs that he might not defile himself.

27:001:009 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with
           the prince of the eunuchs.

27:001:010 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord
           the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why
           should he see your faces worse liking than the children which
           are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to
           the king.

27:001:011 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had
           set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

27:001:012 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them
           give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.

27:001:013 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
           countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the
           king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.

27:001:014 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten
           days.

27:001:015 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer
           and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the
           portion of the king's meat.

27:001:016 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
           that they should drink; and gave them pulse.

27:001:017 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill
           in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in
           all visions and dreams.

27:001:018 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should
           bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in
           before Nebuchadnezzar.

27:001:019 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found
           none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore
           stood they before the king.

27:001:020 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king
           enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the
           magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.

27:001:021 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

27:002:001 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
           Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was
           troubled, and his sleep brake from him.

27:002:002 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the
           astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew
           the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.

27:002:003 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my
           spirit was troubled to know the dream.

27:002:004 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live
           for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the
           interpretation.

27:002:005 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone
           from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the
           interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your
           houses shall be made a dunghill.

27:002:006 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye
           shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour:
           therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.

27:002:007 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants
           the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.

27:002:008 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would
           gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.

27:002:009 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but
           one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt
           words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore
           tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the
           interpretation thereof.

27:002:010 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not
           a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter:
           therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such
           things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.

27:002:011 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is
           none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods,
           whose dwelling is not with flesh.

27:002:012 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and
           commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

27:002:013 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain;
           and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

27:002:014 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
           captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the
           wise men of Babylon:

27:002:015 He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the
           decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing
           known to Daniel.

27:002:016 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would
           give him time, and that he would shew the king the
           interpretation.

27:002:017 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
           Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

27:002:018 That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning
           this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish
           with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

27:002:019 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.
           Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

27:002:020 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever
           and ever: for wisdom and might are his:

27:002:021 And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings,
           and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and
           knowledge to them that know understanding:

27:002:022 He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in
           the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

27:002:023 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who
           hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me
           now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto
           us the king's matter.

27:002:024 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had
           ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said
           thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me
           in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the
           interpretation.

27:002:025 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and
           said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of
           Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.

27:002:026 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was
           Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream
           which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?

27:002:027 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The
           secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the
           astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the
           king;

27:002:028 But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and
           maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
           latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy
           bed, are these;

27:002:029 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy
           bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth
           secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.

27:002:030 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any
           wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes
           that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that
           thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.

27:002:031 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great
           image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and
           the form thereof was terrible.

27:002:032 This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
           silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

27:002:033 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.

27:002:034 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
           smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and
           brake them to pieces.

27:002:035 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
           gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of
           the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away,
           that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the
           image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

27:002:036 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof
           before the king.

27:002:037 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath
           given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.

27:002:038 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
           field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine
           hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this
           head of gold.

27:002:039 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee,
           and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over
           all the earth.

27:002:040 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as
           iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron
           that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.

27:002:041 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters'
           clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but
           there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as
           thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.

27:002:042 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of
           clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly
           broken.

27:002:043 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
           mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not
           cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

27:002:044 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up
           a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
           shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in
           pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for
           ever.

27:002:045 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
           mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron,
           the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God
           hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter:
           and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

27:002:046 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and
           worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an
           oblation and sweet odours unto him.

27:002:047 The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is,
           that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a
           revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.

27:002:048 Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great
           gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon,
           and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.

27:002:049 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach,
           Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of
           Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

27:003:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
           was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he
           set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

27:003:002 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the
           princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the
           treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
           of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which
           Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

27:003:003 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the
           treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
           of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication
           of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they
           stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

27:003:004 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
           nations, and languages,

27:003:005 That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute,
           harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye
           fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
           king hath set up:

27:003:006 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour
           be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

27:003:007 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of
           the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of
           musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell
           down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
           king had set up.

27:003:008 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and
           accused the Jews.

27:003:009 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live
           for ever.

27:003:010 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall
           hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
           and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and
           worship the golden image:

27:003:011 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be
           cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

27:003:012 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of
           the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego;
           these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy
           gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

27:003:013 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
           Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men
           before the king.

27:003:014 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O
           Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor
           worship the golden image which I have set up?

27:003:015 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the
           cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all
           kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I
           have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the
           same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who
           is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?

27:003:016 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the
           king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in
           this matter.

27:003:017 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
           the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine
           hand, O king.

27:003:018 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not
           serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast
           set up.

27:003:019 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his
           visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:
           therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the
           furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.

27:003:020 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to
           bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into
           the burning fiery furnace.

27:003:021 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and
           their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the
           midst of the burning fiery furnace.

27:003:022 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the
           furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men
           that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

27:003:023 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell
           down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

27:003:024 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in
           haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we
           cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered
           and said unto the king, True, O king.

27:003:025 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the
           midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the
           fourth is like the Son of God.

27:003:026 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning
           fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and
           Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and
           come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth
           of the midst of the fire.

27:003:027 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's
           counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon
           whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their
           head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell
           of fire had passed on them.

27:003:028 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of
           Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and
           delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed
           the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not
           serve nor worship any god, except their own God.

27:003:029 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
           language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of
           Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and
           their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no
           other God that can deliver after this sort.

27:003:030 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the
           province of Babylon.

27:004:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and
           languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
           unto you.

27:004:002 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high
           God hath wrought toward me.

27:004:003 How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his
           kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from
           generation to generation.

27:004:004 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in
           my palace:

27:004:005 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my
           bed and the visions of my head troubled me.

27:004:006 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of
           Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the
           interpretation of the dream.

27:004:007 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
           and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but
           they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.

27:004:008 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
           Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is
           the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream,
           saying,

27:004:009 O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that
           the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret
           troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have
           seen, and the interpretation thereof.

27:004:010 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and
           behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height
           thereof was great.

27:004:011 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
           unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the
           earth:

27:004:012 The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and
           in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow
           under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs
           thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.

27:004:013 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a
           watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;

27:004:014 He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off
           his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let
           the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his
           branches:

27:004:015 Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even
           with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
           field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his
           portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:

27:004:016 Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart
           be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.

27:004:017 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand
           by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living
           may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
           giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the
           basest of men.

27:004:018 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
           Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as
           all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto
           me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of
           the holy gods is in thee.

27:004:019 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one
           hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said,
           Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation
           thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My
           lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the
           interpretation thereof to thine enemies.

27:004:020 The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
           height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all
           the earth;

27:004:021 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it
           was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt,
           and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their
           habitation:

27:004:022 It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy
           greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion
           to the end of the earth.

27:004:023 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down
           from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it;
           yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even
           with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
           field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his
           portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass
           over him;

27:004:024 This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of
           the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:

27:004:025 That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
           with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat
           grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven,
           and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the
           most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
           whomsoever he will.

27:004:026 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree
           roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou
           shalt have known that the heavens do rule.

27:004:027 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
           break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by
           shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy
           tranquillity.

27:004:028 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

27:004:029 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
           kingdom of Babylon.

27:004:030 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I
           have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my
           power, and for the honour of my majesty?

27:004:031 While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice
           from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is
           spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.

27:004:032 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
           with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat
           grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until
           thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
           giveth it to whomsoever he will.

27:004:033 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and
           he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his
           body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown
           like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.

27:004:034 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
           eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and
           I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that
           liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion,
           and his kingdom is from generation to generation:

27:004:035 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing:
           and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and
           among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his
           hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?

27:004:036 At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory
           of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me;
           and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was
           established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added
           unto me.

27:004:037 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
           heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and
           those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

27:005:001 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
           lords, and drank wine before the thousand.

27:005:002 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
           golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had
           taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king,
           and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink
           therein.

27:005:003 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of
           the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the
           king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in
           them.

27:005:004 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
           of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

27:005:005 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote
           over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of
           the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that
           wrote.

27:005:006 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts
           troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and
           his knees smote one against another.

27:005:007 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
           Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said
           to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing,
           and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with
           scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be
           the third ruler in the kingdom.

27:005:008 Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read
           the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation
           thereof.

27:005:009 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance
           was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.

27:005:010 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
           came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O
           king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor
           let thy countenance be changed:

27:005:011 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the
           holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and
           understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was
           found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the
           king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians,
           astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;

27:005:012 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and
           understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard
           sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same
           Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be
           called, and he will shew the interpretation.

27:005:013 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake
           and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the
           children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father
           brought out of Jewry?

27:005:014 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in
           thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is
           found in thee.

27:005:015 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in
           before me, that they should read this writing, and make known
           unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew
           the interpretation of the thing:

27:005:016 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make
           interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read
           the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof,
           thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold
           about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.

27:005:017 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts
           be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will
           read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the
           interpretation.

27:005:018 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father
           a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:

27:005:019 And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and
           languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he
           slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he
           set up; and whom he would he put down.

27:005:020 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in
           pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took
           his glory from him:

27:005:021 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made
           like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses:
           they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with
           the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled
           in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it
           whomsoever he will.

27:005:022 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
           though thou knewest all this;

27:005:023 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and
           they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and
           thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk
           wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and
           gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor
           hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and
           whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:

27:005:024 Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing
           was written.

27:005:025 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
           UPHARSIN.

27:005:026 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath
           numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.

27:005:027 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found
           wanting.

27:005:028 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
           Persians.

27:005:029 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with
           scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a
           proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler
           in the kingdom.

27:005:030 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

27:005:031 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore
           and two years old.

27:006:001 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and
           twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;

27:006:002 And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first:
           that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king
           should have no damage.

27:006:003 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and
           princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king
           thought to set him over the whole realm.

27:006:004 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion
           against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find
           none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither
           was there any error or fault found in him.

27:006:005 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
           this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law
           of his God.

27:006:006 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the
           king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.

27:006:007 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the
           princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted
           together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm
           decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man
           for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into
           the den of lions.

27:006:008 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that
           it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and
           Persians, which altereth not.

27:006:009 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.

27:006:010 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into
           his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward
           Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and
           prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.

27:006:011 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
           supplication before his God.

27:006:012 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the
           king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man
           that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty
           days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of
           lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true,
           according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth
           not.

27:006:013 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel,
           which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth
           not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but
           maketh his petition three times a day.

27:006:014 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased
           with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and
           he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.

27:006:015 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the
           king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is,
           That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be
           changed.

27:006:016 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him
           into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto
           Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver
           thee.

27:006:017 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den;
           and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the
           signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed
           concerning Daniel.

27:006:018 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night
           fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before
           him: and his sleep went from him.

27:006:019 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in
           haste unto the den of lions.

27:006:020 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
           unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel,
           servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest
           continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?

27:006:021 Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.

27:006:022 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths,
           that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency
           was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no
           hurt.

27:006:023 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that
           they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken
           up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him,
           because he believed in his God.

27:006:024 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
           accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions,
           them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the
           mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever
           they came at the bottom of the den.

27:006:025 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and
           languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
           unto you.

27:006:026 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men
           tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the
           living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which
           shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto
           the end.

27:006:027 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders
           in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the
           power of the lions.

27:006:028 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the
           reign of Cyrus the Persian.

27:007:001 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a
           dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the
           dream, and told the sum of the matters.

27:007:002 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and,
           behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great
           sea.

27:007:003 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
           another.

27:007:004 The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld
           till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from
           the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's
           heart was given to it.

27:007:005 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it
           raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the
           mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto
           it, Arise, devour much flesh.

27:007:006 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
           upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also
           four heads; and dominion was given to it.

27:007:007 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth
           beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it
           had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and
           stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse
           from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.

27:007:008 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
           another little horn, before whom there were three of the first
           horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were
           eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

27:007:009 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
           days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of
           his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery
           flame, and his wheels as burning fire.

27:007:010 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
           thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten
           thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books
           were opened.

27:007:011 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which
           the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and
           his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

27:007:012 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
           taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and
           time.

27:007:013 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of
           man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of
           days, and they brought him near before him.

27:007:014 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
           that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his
           dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
           away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.

27:007:015 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and
           the visions of my head troubled me.

27:007:016 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the
           truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the
           interpretation of the things.

27:007:017 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which
           shall arise out of the earth.

27:007:018 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
           possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

27:007:019 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
           diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth
           were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in
           pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;

27:007:020 And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other
           which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn
           that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose
           look was more stout than his fellows.

27:007:021 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
           prevailed against them;

27:007:022 Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the
           saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints
           possessed the kingdom.

27:007:023 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
           upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and
           shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and
           break it in pieces.

27:007:024 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
           arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be
           diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.

27:007:025 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and
           shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to
           change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand
           until a time and times and the dividing of time.

27:007:026 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
           dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.

27:007:027 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
           under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the
           saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting
           kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.

27:007:028 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
           cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in
           me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

27:008:001 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
           appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which
           appeared unto me at the first.

27:008:002 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I
           was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of
           Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.

27:008:003 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
           before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns
           were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher
           came up last.

27:008:004 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward;
           so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there
           any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according
           to his will, and became great.

27:008:005 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the
           west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the
           ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.

27:008:006 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
           standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his
           power.

27:008:007 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
           choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two
           horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him,
           but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and
           there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.

27:008:008 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was
           strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four
           notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.

27:008:009 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
           exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and
           toward the pleasant land.

27:008:010 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast
           down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and
           stamped upon them.

27:008:011 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and
           by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of
           the sanctuary was cast down.

27:008:012 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by
           reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the
           ground; and it practised, and prospered.

27:008:013 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
           that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision
           concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of
           desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be
           trodden under foot?

27:008:014 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days;
           then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.

27:008:015 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the
           vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood
           before me as the appearance of a man.

27:008:016 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which
           called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the
           vision.

27:008:017 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
           and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son
           of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.

27:008:018 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my
           face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.

27:008:019 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in
           the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the
           end shall be.

27:008:020 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of
           Media and Persia.

27:008:021 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn
           that is between his eyes is the first king.

27:008:022 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
           kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his
           power.

27:008:023 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the
           transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce
           countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.

27:008:024 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and
           he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise,
           and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.

27:008:025 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
           his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by
           peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the
           Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.

27:008:026 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told
           is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be
           for many days.

27:008:027 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I
           rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at
           the vision, but none understood it.

27:009:001 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed
           of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the
           Chaldeans;

27:009:002 In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books
           the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to
           Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years
           in the desolations of Jerusalem.

27:009:003 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
           supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:

27:009:004 And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and
           said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant
           and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his
           commandments;

27:009:005 We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done
           wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy
           precepts and from thy judgments:

27:009:006 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets,
           which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our
           fathers, and to all the people of the land.

27:009:007 O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us
           confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and
           to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are
           near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither
           thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they
           have trespassed against thee.

27:009:008 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to
           our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned
           against thee.

27:009:009 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though
           we have rebelled against him;

27:009:010 Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk
           in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the
           prophets.

27:009:011 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
           that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is
           poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of
           Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.

27:009:012 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us,
           and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a
           great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as
           hath been done upon Jerusalem.

27:009:013 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come
           upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God,
           that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy
           truth.

27:009:014 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it
           upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works
           which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.

27:009:015 And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth
           out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten
           thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done
           wickedly.

27:009:016 O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee,
           let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city
           Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for
           the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are
           become a reproach to all that are about us.

27:009:017 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and
           his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy
           sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.

27:009:018 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
           behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy
           name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for
           our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.

27:009:019 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer
           not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people
           are called by thy name.

27:009:020 And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin
           and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my
           supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of
           my God;

27:009:021 Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel,
           whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused
           to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening
           oblation.

27:009:022 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I
           am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

27:009:023 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came
           forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly
           beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the
           vision.

27:009:024 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
           city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,
           and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
           everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
           prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.

27:009:025 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of
           the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
           Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and
           two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even
           in troublous times.

27:009:026 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off,
           but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall
           come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end
           thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war
           desolations are determined.

27:009:027 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and
           in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the
           oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations
           he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and
           that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

27:010:001 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
           unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing
           was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood
           the thing, and had understanding of the vision.

27:010:002 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.

27:010:003 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my
           mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole
           weeks were fulfilled.

27:010:004 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was
           by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;

27:010:005 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain
           man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold
           of Uphaz:

27:010:006 His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the
           appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and
           his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and
           the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.

27:010:007 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with
           me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so
           that they fled to hide themselves.

27:010:008 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and
           there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned
           in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.

27:010:009 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice
           of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my
           face toward the ground.

27:010:010 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees
           and upon the palms of my hands.

27:010:011 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved,
           understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand
           upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken
           this word unto me, I stood trembling.

27:010:012 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
           that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten
           thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come
           for thy words.

27:010:013 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
           twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came
           to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.

27:010:014 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
           people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many
           days.

27:010:015 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face
           toward the ground, and I became dumb.

27:010:016 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men
           touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said
           unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my
           sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.

27:010:017 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my
           lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in
           me, neither is there breath left in me.

27:010:018 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance
           of a man, and he strengthened me,

27:010:019 And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee,
           be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I
           was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast
           strengthened me.

27:010:020 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
           will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I
           am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.

27:010:021 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
           truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things,
           but Michael your prince.

27:011:001 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to
           confirm and to strengthen him.

27:011:002 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand
           up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far
           richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches
           he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.

27:011:003 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
           dominion, and do according to his will.

27:011:004 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
           shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to
           his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled:
           for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside
           those.

27:011:005 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his
           princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion;
           his dominion shall be a great dominion.

27:011:006 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together;
           for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of
           the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the
           power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she
           shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that
           begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.

27:011:007 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
           estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into
           the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against
           them, and shall prevail:

27:011:008 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with
           their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and
           of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the
           north.

27:011:009 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and
           shall return into his own land.

27:011:010 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a
           multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and
           overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be
           stirred up, even to his fortress.

27:011:011 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and
           shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the
           north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the
           multitude shall be given into his hand.

27:011:012 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be
           lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he
           shall not be strengthened by it.

27:011:013 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
           multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come
           after certain years with a great army and with much riches.

27:011:014 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king
           of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt
           themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.

27:011:015 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and
           take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall
           not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there
           be any strength to withstand.

27:011:016 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
           will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in
           the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.

27:011:017 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
           whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do:
           and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her:
           but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.

27:011:018 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall
           take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the
           reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he
           shall cause it to turn upon him.

27:011:019 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land:
           but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.

27:011:020 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the
           glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be
           destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.

27:011:021 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they
           shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in
           peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

27:011:022 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from
           before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the
           covenant.

27:011:023 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:
           for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small
           people.

27:011:024 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
           province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not
           done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them
           the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast
           his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.

27:011:025 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the
           king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south
           shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty
           army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices
           against him.

27:011:026 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
           him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down
           slain.

27:011:027 And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and
           they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper:
           for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.

27:011:028 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
           heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do
           exploits, and return to his own land.

27:011:029 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
           south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.

27:011:030 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he
           shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the
           holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have
           intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.

27:011:031 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
           sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily
           sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh
           desolate.

27:011:032 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt
           by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be
           strong, and do exploits.

27:011:033 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
           yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity,
           and by spoil, many days.

27:011:034 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
           help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.

27:011:035 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and
           to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end:
           because it is yet for a time appointed.

27:011:036 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall
           exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall
           speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall
           prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is
           determined shall be done.

27:011:037 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
           of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself
           above all.

27:011:038 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god
           whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and
           silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.

27:011:039 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
           whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he
           shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land
           for gain.

27:011:040 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
           him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a
           whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many
           ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall
           overflow and pass over.

27:011:041 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
           shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand,
           even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.

27:011:042 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and
           the land of Egypt shall not escape.

27:011:043 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
           silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the
           Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.

27:011:044 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
           him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy,
           and utterly to make away many.

27:011:045 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
           seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his
           end, and none shall help him.

27:012:001 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince
           which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall
           be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a
           nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people
           shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in
           the book.

27:012:002 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
           awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
           everlasting contempt.

27:012:003 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
           firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the
           stars for ever and ever.

27:012:004 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even
           to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
           knowledge shall be increased.

27:012:005 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the
           one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on
           that side of the bank of the river.

27:012:006 And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
           waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these
           wonders?

27:012:007 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
           waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his
           left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever
           that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he
           shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy
           people, all these things shall be finished.

27:012:008 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord,
           what shall be the end of these things?

27:012:009 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up
           and sealed till the time of the end.

27:012:010 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
           wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
           understand; but the wise shall understand.

27:012:011 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken
           away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there
           shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.

27:012:012 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three
           hundred and five and thirty days.

27:012:013 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and
           stand in thy lot at the end of the days.

Book 28        Hosea

28:001:001 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri,
           in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
           Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of
           Israel.

28:001:002 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD
           said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and
           children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great
           whoredom, departing from the LORD.

28:001:003 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
           conceived, and bare him a son.

28:001:004 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
           little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the
           house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the
           house of Israel.

28:001:005 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the
           bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.

28:001:006 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said
           unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have
           mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them
           away.

28:001:007 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save
           them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor
           by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

28:001:008 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a
           son.

28:001:009 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people,
           and I will not be your God.

28:001:010 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand
           of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it
           shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto
           them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them,
           Ye are the sons of the living God.

28:001:011 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
           gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they
           shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of
           Jezreel.

28:002:001 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

28:002:002 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither
           am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out
           of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;

28:002:003 Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was
           born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry
           land, and slay her with thirst.

28:002:004 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the
           children of whoredoms.

28:002:005 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived
           them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my
           lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my
           flax, mine oil and my drink.

28:002:006 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and
           make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.

28:002:007 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
           overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
           them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first
           husband; for then was it better with me than now.

28:002:008 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
           and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for
           Baal.

28:002:009 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
           thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover
           my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.

28:002:010 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her
           lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.

28:002:011 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her
           new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

28:002:012 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she
           hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me:
           and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field
           shall eat them.

28:002:013 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she
           burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her
           earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and
           forgat me, saith the LORD.

28:002:014 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
           wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.

28:002:015 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley
           of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in
           the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out
           of the land of Egypt.

28:002:016 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt
           call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.

28:002:017 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and
           they shall no more be remembered by their name.

28:002:018 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the
           beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the
           creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and
           the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them
           to lie down safely.

28:002:019 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
           thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in
           lovingkindness, and in mercies.

28:002:020 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou
           shalt know the LORD.

28:002:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the
           LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;

28:002:022 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil;
           and they shall hear Jezreel.

28:002:023 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy
           upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them
           which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall
           say, Thou art my God.

28:003:001 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of
           her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the
           LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods,
           and love flagons of wine.

28:003:002 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
           homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:

28:003:003 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou
           shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another
           man: so will I also be for thee.

28:003:004 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
           king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and
           without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:

28:003:005 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
           LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD
           and his goodness in the latter days.

28:004:001 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD
           hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
           there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the
           land.

28:004:002 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and
           committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.

28:004:003 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
           therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with
           the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be
           taken away.

28:004:004 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are
           as they that strive with the priest.

28:004:005 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also
           shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy
           mother.

28:004:006 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou
           hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou
           shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law
           of thy God, I will also forget thy children.

28:004:007 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore
           will I change their glory into shame.

28:004:008 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
           their iniquity.

28:004:009 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will
           punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.

28:004:010 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
           whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off
           to take heed to the LORD.

28:004:011 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

28:004:012 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff
           declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused
           them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their
           God.

28:004:013 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn
           incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,
           because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters
           shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.

28:004:014 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom,
           nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are
           separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots:
           therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.

28:004:015 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah
           offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to
           Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.

28:004:016 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD
           will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

28:004:017 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

28:004:018 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:
           her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.

28:004:019 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be
           ashamed because of their sacrifices.

28:005:001 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and
           give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you,
           because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon
           Tabor.

28:005:002 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I
           have been a rebuker of them all.

28:005:003 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O
           Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.

28:005:004 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for
           the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have
           not known the LORD.

28:005:005 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore
           shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also
           shall fall with them.

28:005:006 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek
           the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn
           himself from them.

28:005:007 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have
           begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with
           their portions.

28:005:008 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry
           aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.

28:005:009 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the
           tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.

28:005:010 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
           therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.

28:005:011 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he
           willingly walked after the commandment.

28:005:012 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house
           of Judah as rottenness.

28:005:013 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then
           went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet
           could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.

28:005:014 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to
           the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will
           take away, and none shall rescue him.

28:005:015 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
           offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek
           me early.

28:006:001 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and
           he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

28:006:002 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will
           raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

28:006:003 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his
           going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto
           us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

28:006:004 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do
           unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the
           early dew it goeth away.

28:006:005 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them
           by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light
           that goeth forth.

28:006:006 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of
           God more than burnt offerings.

28:006:007 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have
           they dealt treacherously against me.

28:006:008 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted
           with blood.

28:006:009 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of
           priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit
           lewdness.

28:006:010 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is
           the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

28:006:011 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I
           returned the captivity of my people.

28:007:001 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim
           was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit
           falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers
           spoileth without.

28:007:002 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all
           their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about;
           they are before my face.

28:007:003 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
           with their lies.

28:007:004 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who
           ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it
           be leavened.

28:007:005 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with
           bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

28:007:006 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they
           lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the
           morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

28:007:007 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges;
           all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that
           calleth unto me.

28:007:008 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a
           cake not turned.

28:007:009 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not:
           yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth
           not.

28:007:010 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do
           not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

28:007:011 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
           Egypt, they go to Assyria.

28:007:012 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will
           bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise
           them, as their congregation hath heard.

28:007:013 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto
           them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have
           redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

28:007:014 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they
           howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and
           wine, and they rebel against me.

28:007:015 Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they
           imagine mischief against me.

28:007:016 They return, but not to the most High: they are like a
           deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the
           rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land
           of Egypt.

28:008:001 Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle
           against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed
           my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

28:008:002 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

28:008:003 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall
           pursue him.

28:008:004 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes,
           and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they
           made them idols, that they may be cut off.

28:008:005 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled
           against them: how long will it be ere they attain to
           innocency?

28:008:006 For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it
           is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

28:008:007 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the
           whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if
           so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.

28:008:008 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles
           as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.

28:008:009 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:
           Ephraim hath hired lovers.

28:008:010 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I
           gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of
           the king of princes.

28:008:011 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be
           unto him to sin.

28:008:012 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they
           were counted as a strange thing.

28:008:013 They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
           eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember
           their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to
           Egypt.

28:008:014 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
           Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire
           upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

28:009:001 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast
           gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon
           every cornfloor.

28:009:002 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new
           wine shall fail in her.

28:009:003 They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall
           return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.

28:009:004 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall
           they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them
           as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be
           polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into
           the house of the LORD.

28:009:005 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast
           of the LORD?

28:009:006 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall
           gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places
           for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be
           in their tabernacles.

28:009:007 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are
           come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the
           spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and
           the great hatred.

28:009:008 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a
           snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of
           his God.

28:009:009 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of
           Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will
           visit their sins.

28:009:010 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your
           fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time:
           but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that
           shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.

28:009:011 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from
           the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.

28:009:012 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,
           that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when
           I depart from them!

28:009:013 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but
           Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.

28:009:014 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a
           miscarrying womb and dry breasts.

28:009:015 All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for
           the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine
           house, I will love them no more: all their princes are
           revolters.

28:009:016 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no
           fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the
           beloved fruit of their womb.

28:009:017 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto
           him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

28:010:001 Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
           according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the
           altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made
           goodly images.

28:010:002 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he
           shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.

28:010:003 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not
           the LORD; what then should a king do to us?

28:010:004 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant:
           thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the
           field.

28:010:005 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
           Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the
           priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof,
           because it is departed from it.

28:010:006 It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
           Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be
           ashamed of his own counsel.

28:010:007 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the
           water.

28:010:008 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be
           destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their
           altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to
           the hills, Fall on us.

28:010:009 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they
           stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity
           did not overtake them.

28:010:010 It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people
           shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind
           themselves in their two furrows.

28:010:011 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to
           tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I
           will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall
           break his clods.

28:010:012 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up
           your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he
           come and rain righteousness upon you.

28:010:013 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
           eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way,
           in the multitude of thy mighty men.

28:010:014 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
           fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in
           the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her
           children.

28:010:015 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness:
           in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

28:011:001 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son
           out of Egypt.

28:011:002 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed
           unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

28:011:003 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but
           they knew not that I healed them.

28:011:004 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was
           to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I
           laid meat unto them.

28:011:005 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian
           shall be his king, because they refused to return.

28:011:006 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his
           branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.

28:011:007 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they
           called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.

28:011:008 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,
           Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee
           as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are
           kindled together.

28:011:009 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not
           return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy
           One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

28:011:010 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion:
           when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the
           west.

28:011:011 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out
           of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses,
           saith the LORD.

28:011:012 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel
           with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful
           with the saints.

28:012:001 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he
           daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a
           covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

28:012:002 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish
           Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he
           recompense him.

28:012:003 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his
           strength he had power with God:

28:012:004 Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and
           made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there
           he spake with us;

28:012:005 Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.

28:012:006 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and
           wait on thy God continually.

28:012:007 He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he
           loveth to oppress.

28:012:008 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out
           substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in
           me that were sin.

28:012:009 And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
           make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the
           solemn feast.

28:012:010 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied
           visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the
           prophets.

28:012:011 Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they
           sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps
           in the furrows of the fields.

28:012:012 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served
           for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.

28:012:013 And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by
           a prophet was he preserved.

28:012:014 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall
           he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD
           return unto him.

28:013:001 When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel;
           but when he offended in Baal, he died.

28:013:002 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten
           images of their silver, and idols according to their own
           understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say
           of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.

28:013:003 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early
           dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the
           whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the
           chimney.

28:013:004 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou
           shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.

28:013:005 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great
           drought.

28:013:006 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were
           filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they
           forgotten me.

28:013:007 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the
           way will I observe them:

28:013:008 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and
           will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour
           them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.

28:013:009 O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine
           help.

28:013:010 I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in
           all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a
           king and princes?

28:013:011 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my
           wrath.

28:013:012 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.

28:013:013 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is
           an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the
           breaking forth of children.

28:013:014 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem
           them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I
           will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine
           eyes.

28:013:015 Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall
           come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness,
           and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be
           dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

28:013:016 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against
           her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be
           dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped
           up.

28:014:001 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen
           by thine iniquity.

28:014:002 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take
           away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we
           render the calves of our lips.

28:014:003 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses:
           neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are
           our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.

28:014:004 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for
           mine anger is turned away from him.

28:014:005 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily,
           and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

28:014:006 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the
           olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

28:014:007 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall
           revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof
           shall be as the wine of Lebanon.

28:014:008 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I
           have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree.
           From me is thy fruit found.

28:014:009 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent,
           and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right,
           and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall
           fall therein.

Book 29        Joel

29:001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

29:001:002 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
           land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your
           fathers?

29:001:003 Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their
           children, and their children another generation.

29:001:004 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and
           that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and
           that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller
           eaten.

29:001:005 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of
           wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your
           mouth.

29:001:006 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without
           number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the
           cheek teeth of a great lion.

29:001:007 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath
           made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are
           made white.

29:001:008 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of
           her youth.

29:001:009 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the
           house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.

29:001:010 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is
           wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.

29:001:011 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for
           the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field
           is perished.

29:001:012 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the
           pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even
           all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is
           withered away from the sons of men.

29:001:013 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of
           the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of
           my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is
           withholden from the house of your God.

29:001:014 Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders
           and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD
           your God, and cry unto the LORD,

29:001:015 Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a
           destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

29:001:016 Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness
           from the house of our God?

29:001:017 The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid
           desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.

29:001:018 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,
           because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are
           made desolate.

29:001:019 O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the
           pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the
           trees of the field.

29:001:020 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of
           waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures
           of the wilderness.

29:002:001 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
           mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the
           day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;

29:002:002 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of
           thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a
           great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like,
           neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many
           generations.

29:002:003 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth:
           the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them
           a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

29:002:004 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as
           horsemen, so shall they run.

29:002:005 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they
           leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the
           stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.

29:002:006 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces
           shall gather blackness.

29:002:007 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like
           men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and
           they shall not break their ranks:

29:002:008 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in
           his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be
           wounded.

29:002:009 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the
           wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in
           at the windows like a thief.

29:002:010 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble:
           the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall
           withdraw their shining:

29:002:011 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his
           camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word:
           for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who
           can abide it?

29:002:012 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with
           all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
           mourning:

29:002:013 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
           LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger,
           and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

29:002:014 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
           behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the
           LORD your God?

29:002:015 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn
           assembly:

29:002:016 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the
           elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts:
           let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out
           of her closet.

29:002:017 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the
           porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O
           LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the
           heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among
           the people, Where is their God?

29:002:018 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his
           people.

29:002:019 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I
           will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be
           satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach
           among the heathen:

29:002:020 But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will
           drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face
           toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost
           sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall
           come up, because he hath done great things.

29:002:021 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do
           great things.

29:002:022 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
           wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig
           tree and the vine do yield their strength.

29:002:023 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD
           your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately,
           and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former
           rain, and the latter rain in the first month.

29:002:024 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall
           overflow with wine and oil.

29:002:025 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath
           eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the
           palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.

29:002:026 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the
           name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with
           you: and my people shall never be ashamed.

29:002:027 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I
           am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never
           be ashamed.

29:002:028 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my
           spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall
           prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men
           shall see visions:

29:002:029 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those
           days will I pour out my spirit.

29:002:030 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth,
           blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.

29:002:031 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
           blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.

29:002:032 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the
           name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in
           Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in
           the remnant whom the LORD shall call.

29:003:001 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall
           bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

29:003:002 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into
           the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for
           my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered
           among the nations, and parted my land.

29:003:003 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy
           for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might
           drink.

29:003:004 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and
           all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence?
           and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return
           your recompence upon your own head;

29:003:005 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried
           into your temples my goodly pleasant things:

29:003:006 The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have
           ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from
           their border.

29:003:007 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have
           sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:

29:003:008 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of
           the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the
           Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it.

29:003:009 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the
           mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come
           up:

29:003:010 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into
           spears: let the weak say, I am strong.

29:003:011 Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather
           yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones
           to come down, O LORD.

29:003:012 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of
           Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen
           round about.

29:003:013 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you
           down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their
           wickedness is great.

29:003:014 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day
           of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.

29:003:015 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall
           withdraw their shining.

29:003:016 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from
           Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the
           LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the
           children of Israel.

29:003:017 So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion,
           my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there
           shall no strangers pass through her any more.

29:003:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains
           shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk,
           and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a
           fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and
           shall water the valley of Shittim.

29:003:019 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate
           wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah,
           because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

29:003:020 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation
           to generation.

29:003:021 For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for
           the LORD dwelleth in Zion.

Book 30        Amos

30:001:001 The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which
           he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah,
           and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel,
           two years before the earthquake.

30:001:002 And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice
           from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall
           mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.

30:001:003 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and
           for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
           they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:

30:001:004 But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall
           devour the palaces of Benhadad.

30:001:005 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the
           inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the
           sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall
           go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.

30:001:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for
           four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
           they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them
           up to Edom:

30:001:007 But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour
           the palaces thereof:

30:001:008 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that
           holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand
           against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall
           perish, saith the Lord GOD.

30:001:009 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and
           for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
           they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered
           not the brotherly covenant:

30:001:010 But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall
           devour the palaces thereof.

30:001:011 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for
           four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he
           did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all
           pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his
           wrath for ever:

30:001:012 But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the
           palaces of Bozrah.

30:001:013 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children
           of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment
           thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of
           Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:

30:001:014 But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall
           devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of
           battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:

30:001:015 And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes
           together, saith the LORD.

30:002:001 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for
           four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he
           burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:

30:002:002 But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the
           palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with
           shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:

30:002:003 And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will
           slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.

30:002:004 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and
           for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
           they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his
           commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the
           which their fathers have walked:

30:002:005 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the
           palaces of Jerusalem.

30:002:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and
           for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
           they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of
           shoes;

30:002:007 That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,
           and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father
           will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:

30:002:008 And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by
           every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the
           house of their god.

30:002:009 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like
           the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I
           destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

30:002:010 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you
           forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the
           Amorite.

30:002:011 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young
           men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of
           Israel? saith the LORD.

30:002:012 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the
           prophets, saying, Prophesy not.

30:002:013 Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is
           full of sheaves.

30:002:014 Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the
           strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the
           mighty deliver himself:

30:002:015 Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is
           swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that
           rideth the horse deliver himself.

30:002:016 And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away
           naked in that day, saith the LORD.

30:003:001 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O
           children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought
           up from the land of Egypt, saying,

30:003:002 You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
           therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.

30:003:003 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?

30:003:004 Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a
           young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?

30:003:005 Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for
           him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken
           nothing at all?

30:003:006 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be
           afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not
           done it?

30:003:007 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his
           secret unto his servants the prophets.

30:003:008 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath
           spoken, who can but prophesy?

30:003:009 Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the
           land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains
           of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof,
           and the oppressed in the midst thereof.

30:003:010 For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up
           violence and robbery in their palaces.

30:003:011 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be
           even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy
           strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.

30:003:012 Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth
           of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the
           children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the
           corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.

30:003:013 Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord
           GOD, the God of hosts,

30:003:014 That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of
           Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and
           the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the
           ground.

30:003:015 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and
           the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall
           have an end, saith the LORD.

30:004:001 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of
           Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which
           say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.

30:004:002 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days
           shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks,
           and your posterity with fishhooks.

30:004:003 And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which
           is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith
           the LORD.

30:004:004 Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply
           transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and
           your tithes after three years:

30:004:005 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and
           proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you,
           O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

30:004:006 And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your
           cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not
           returned unto me, saith the LORD.

30:004:007 And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were
           yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon
           one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one
           piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not
           withered.

30:004:008 So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water;
           but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me,
           saith the LORD.

30:004:009 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens
           and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees
           increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not
           returned unto me, saith the LORD.

30:004:010 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of
           Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have
           taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your
           camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned
           unto me, saith the LORD.

30:004:011 I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and
           Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the
           burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

30:004:012 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I
           will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

30:004:013 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,
           and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the
           morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the
           earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.

30:005:001 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a
           lamentation, O house of Israel.

30:005:002 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is
           forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.

30:005:003 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a
           thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by
           an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.

30:005:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me,
           and ye shall live:

30:005:005 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to
           Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and
           Bethel shall come to nought.

30:005:006 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire
           in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to
           quench it in Bethel.

30:005:007 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness
           in the earth,

30:005:008 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth
           the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark
           with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and
           poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his
           name:

30:005:009 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the
           spoiled shall come against the fortress.

30:005:010 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him
           that speaketh uprightly.

30:005:011 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye
           take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn
           stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted
           pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.

30:005:012 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins:
           they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside
           the poor in the gate from their right.

30:005:013 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it
           is an evil time.

30:005:014 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD,
           the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

30:005:015 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in
           the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be
           gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.

30:005:016 Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus;
           Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the
           highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to
           mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.

30:005:017 And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through
           thee, saith the LORD.

30:005:018 Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is
           it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.

30:005:019 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went
           into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent
           bit him.

30:005:020 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even
           very dark, and no brightness in it?

30:005:021 I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in
           your solemn assemblies.

30:005:022 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I
           will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace
           offerings of your fat beasts.

30:005:023 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not
           hear the melody of thy viols.

30:005:024 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a
           mighty stream.

30:005:025 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
           wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

30:005:026 But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your
           images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

30:005:027 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond
           Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.

30:006:001 Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the
           mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to
           whom the house of Israel came!

30:006:002 Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath
           the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they
           better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your
           border?

30:006:003 Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of
           violence to come near;

30:006:004 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their
           couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves
           out of the midst of the stall;

30:006:005 That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves
           instruments of musick, like David;

30:006:006 That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief
           ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of
           Joseph.

30:006:007 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go
           captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves
           shall be removed.

30:006:008 The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of
           hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces:
           therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.

30:006:009 And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one
           house, that they shall die.

30:006:010 And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him,
           to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto
           him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with
           thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy
           tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.

30:006:011 For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great
           house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.

30:006:012 Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen?
           for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of
           righteousness into hemlock:

30:006:013 Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not
           taken to us horns by our own strength?

30:006:014 But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of
           Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall
           afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of
           the wilderness.

30:007:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed
           grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter
           growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's
           mowings.

30:007:002 And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating
           the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I
           beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.

30:007:003 The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.

30:007:004 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord
           GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep,
           and did eat up a part.

30:007:005 Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall
           Jacob arise? for he is small.

30:007:006 The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the
           Lord GOD.

30:007:007 Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall
           made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

30:007:008 And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said,
           A plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a
           plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again
           pass by them any more:

30:007:009 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the
           sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise
           against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

30:007:010 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
           Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst
           of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his
           words.

30:007:011 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and
           Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

30:007:012 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away
           into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy
           there:

30:007:013 But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the
           king's chapel, and it is the king's court.

30:007:014 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet,
           neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a
           gatherer of sycomore fruit:

30:007:015 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD
           said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

30:007:016 Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest,
           Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the
           house of Isaac.

30:007:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in
           the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the
           sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt
           die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into
           captivity forth of his land.

30:008:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of
           summer fruit.

30:008:002 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of
           summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon
           my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.

30:008:003 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day,
           saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every
           place; they shall cast them forth with silence.

30:008:004 Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the
           poor of the land to fail,

30:008:005 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn?
           and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah
           small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by
           deceit?

30:008:006 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair
           of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?

30:008:007 The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will
           never forget any of their works.

30:008:008 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that
           dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and
           it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

30:008:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD,
           that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will
           darken the earth in the clear day:

30:008:010 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs
           into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all
           loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the
           mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.

30:008:011 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a
           famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for
           water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:

30:008:012 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even
           to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the
           LORD, and shall not find it.

30:008:013 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for
           thirst.

30:008:014 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O
           Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they
           shall fall, and never rise up again.

30:009:001 I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the
           lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in
           the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with
           the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he
           that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.

30:009:002 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them;
           though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:

30:009:003 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will
           search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from
           my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the
           serpent, and he shall bite them:

30:009:004 And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence
           will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will
           set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.

30:009:005 And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it
           shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it
           shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by
           the flood of Egypt.

30:009:006 It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath
           founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters
           of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth:
           The LORD is his name.

30:009:007 Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children
           of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of
           the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the
           Syrians from Kir?

30:009:008 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom,
           and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving
           that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the
           LORD.

30:009:009 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel
           among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet
           shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.

30:009:010 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which
           say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.

30:009:011 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is
           fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up
           his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:

30:009:012 That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the
           heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that
           doeth this.

30:009:013 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall
           overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth
           seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the
           hills shall melt.

30:009:014 And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel,
           and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and
           they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they
           shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

30:009:015 And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more
           be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith
           the LORD thy God.

Book 31        Obadiah

31:001:001 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning
           Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador
           is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up
           against her in battle.

31:001:002 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
           greatly despised.

31:001:003 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that
           dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high;
           that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the
           ground?

31:001:004 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set
           thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith
           the LORD.

31:001:005 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou
           cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if
           the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some
           grapes?

31:001:006 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden
           things sought up!

31:001:007 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the
           border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
           thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have
           laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.

31:001:008 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise
           men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

31:001:009 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end
           that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by
           slaughter.

31:001:010 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
           thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

31:001:011 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day
           that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and
           foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
           Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.

31:001:012 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother
           in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou
           have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
           destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the
           day of distress.

31:001:013 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in
           the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
           on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have
           laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;

31:001:014 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off
           those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have
           delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of
           distress.

31:001:015 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou
           hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return
           upon thine own head.

31:001:016 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the
           heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they
           shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not
           been.

31:001:017 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
           holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
           possessions.

31:001:018 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of
           Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they
           shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be
           any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken
           it.

31:001:019 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and
           they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the
           fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin
           shall possess Gilead.

31:001:020 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
           possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the
           captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess
           the cities of the south.

31:001:021 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of
           Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

Book 32        Jonah

32:001:001 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
           saying,

32:001:002 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for
           their wickedness is come up before me.

32:001:003 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of
           the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to
           Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it,
           to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.

32:001:004 But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was
           a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be
           broken.

32:001:005 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his
           god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the
           sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the
           sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.

32:001:006 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest
           thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God
           will think upon us, that we perish not.

32:001:007 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast
           lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.
           So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

32:001:008 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose
           cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and
           whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people
           art thou?

32:001:009 And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD,
           the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.

32:001:010 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why
           hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the
           presence of the LORD, because he had told them.

32:001:011 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the
           sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was
           tempestuous.

32:001:012 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the
           sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my
           sake this great tempest is upon you.

32:001:013 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but
           they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous
           against them.

32:001:014 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee,
           O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's
           life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD,
           hast done as it pleased thee.

32:001:015 So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and
           the sea ceased from her raging.

32:001:016 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a
           sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.

32:001:017 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
           And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three
           nights.

32:002:001 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's
           belly,

32:002:002 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
           and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou
           heardest my voice.

32:002:003 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the
           seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and
           thy waves passed over me.

32:002:004 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again
           toward thy holy temple.

32:002:005 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth
           closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

32:002:006 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with
           her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my
           life from corruption, O LORD my God.

32:002:007 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my
           prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

32:002:008 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

32:002:009 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
           I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

32:002:010 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
           upon the dry land.

32:003:001 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time,
           saying,

32:003:002 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it
           the preaching that I bid thee.

32:003:003 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word
           of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three
           days' journey.

32:003:004 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
           cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
           overthrown.

32:003:005 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
           and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the
           least of them.

32:003:006 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
           throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with
           sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

32:003:007 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through
           Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
           neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let
           them not feed, nor drink water:

32:003:008 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
           mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil
           way, and from the violence that is in their hands.

32:003:009 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from
           his fierce anger, that we perish not?

32:003:010 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way;
           and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would
           do unto them; and he did it not.

32:004:001 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

32:004:002 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD,
           was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?
           Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou
           art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
           kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

32:004:003 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me;
           for it is better for me to die than to live.

32:004:004 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?

32:004:005 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the
           city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
           shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.

32:004:006 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over
           Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him
           from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

32:004:007 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day,
           and it smote the gourd that it withered.

32:004:008 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared
           a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
           that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is
           better for me to die than to live.

32:004:009 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the
           gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.

32:004:010 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
           which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which
           came up in a night, and perished in a night:

32:004:011 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
           more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern
           between their right hand and their left hand; and also much
           cattle?

Book 33        Micah

33:001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the
           days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he
           saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

33:001:002 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein
           is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from
           his holy temple.

33:001:003 For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will
           come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.

33:001:004 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys
           shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that
           are poured down a steep place.

33:001:005 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins
           of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is
           it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are
           they not Jerusalem?

33:001:006 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as
           plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones
           thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations
           thereof.

33:001:007 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,
           and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and
           all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it
           of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of
           an harlot.

33:001:008 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked:
           I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the
           owls.

33:001:009 For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is
           come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.

33:001:010 Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of
           Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.

33:001:011 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame
           naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning
           of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.

33:001:012 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but
           evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.

33:001:013 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift
           beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of
           Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

33:001:014 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the
           houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.

33:001:015 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah:
           he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

33:001:016 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children;
           enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into
           captivity from thee.

33:002:001 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their
           beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it
           is in the power of their hand.

33:002:002 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses,
           and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even
           a man and his heritage.

33:002:003 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do
           I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks;
           neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.

33:002:004 In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and
           lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly
           spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he
           removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.

33:002:005 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot
           in the congregation of the LORD.

33:002:006 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall
           not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.

33:002:007 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the
           LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good
           to him that walketh uprightly?

33:002:008 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off
           the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as
           men averse from war.

33:002:009 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant
           houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for
           ever.

33:002:010 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is
           polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

33:002:011 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I
           will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall
           even be the prophet of this people.

33:002:012 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely
           gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the
           sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they
           shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.

33:002:013 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and
           have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and
           their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of
           them.

33:003:001 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes
           of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?

33:003:002 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin
           from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

33:003:003 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
           off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces,
           as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

33:003:004 Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them:
           he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they
           have behaved themselves ill in their doings.

33:003:005 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my
           people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he
           that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war
           against him.

33:003:006 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a
           vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not
           divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the
           day shall be dark over them.

33:003:007 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:
           yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer
           of God.

33:003:008 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of
           judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his
           transgression, and to Israel his sin.

33:003:009 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and
           princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and
           pervert all equity.

33:003:010 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

33:003:011 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof
           teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet
           will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among
           us? none evil can come upon us.

33:003:012 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and
           Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as
           the high places of the forest.

33:004:001 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain
           of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of
           the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and
           people shall flow unto it.

33:004:002 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up
           to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of
           Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in
           his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of
           the LORD from Jerusalem.

33:004:003 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong
           nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into
           plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall
           not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn
           war any more.

33:004:004 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig
           tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the
           LORD of hosts hath spoken it.

33:004:005 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and
           we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and
           ever.

33:004:006 In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth,
           and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have
           afflicted;

33:004:007 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was
           cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over
           them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.

33:004:008 And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the
           daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first
           dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

33:004:009 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is
           thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman
           in travail.

33:004:010 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion,
           like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of
           the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go
           even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD
           shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.

33:004:011 Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let
           her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

33:004:012 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand
           they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into
           the floor.

33:004:013 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine
           horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt
           beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain
           unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole
           earth.

33:005:001 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath
           laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel
           with a rod upon the cheek.

33:005:002 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
           thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
           me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been
           from of old, from everlasting.

33:005:003 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which
           travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his
           brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.

33:005:004 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in
           the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall
           abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

33:005:005 And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come
           into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then
           shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight
           principal men.

33:005:006 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and
           the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he
           deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land,
           and when he treadeth within our borders.

33:005:007 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people
           as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that
           tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.

33:005:008 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the
           midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest,
           as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go
           through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none
           can deliver.

33:005:009 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all
           thine enemies shall be cut off.

33:005:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I
           will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will
           destroy thy chariots:

33:005:011 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all
           thy strong holds:

33:005:012 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou
           shalt have no more soothsayers:

33:005:013 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images
           out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the
           work of thine hands.

33:005:014 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so
           will I destroy thy cities.

33:005:015 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the
           heathen, such as they have not heard.

33:006:001 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before
           the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

33:006:002 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong
           foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with
           his people, and he will plead with Israel.

33:006:003 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I
           wearied thee? testify against me.

33:006:004 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
           thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee
           Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

33:006:005 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted,
           and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto
           Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.

33:006:006 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before
           the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
           with calves of a year old?

33:006:007 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
           thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my
           transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

33:006:008 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the
           LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
           to walk humbly with thy God?

33:006:009 The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom
           shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed
           it.

33:006:010 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
           wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?

33:006:011 Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the
           bag of deceitful weights?

33:006:012 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the
           inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is
           deceitful in their mouth.

33:006:013 Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in
           making thee desolate because of thy sins.

33:006:014 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down
           shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but
           shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give
           up to the sword.

33:006:015 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the
           olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet
           wine, but shalt not drink wine.

33:006:016 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the
           house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should
           make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an
           hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

33:007:001 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer
           fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no
           cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.

33:007:002 The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none
           upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt
           every man his brother with a net.

33:007:003 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
           asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man,
           he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

33:007:004 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper
           than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation
           cometh; now shall be their perplexity.

33:007:005 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide:
           keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

33:007:006 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up
           against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in
           law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.

33:007:007 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God
           of my salvation: my God will hear me.

33:007:008 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall
           arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto
           me.

33:007:009 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned
           against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for
           me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold
           his righteousness.

33:007:010 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall
           cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine
           eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the
           mire of the streets.

33:007:011 In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall
           the decree be far removed.

33:007:012 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and
           from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the
           river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.

33:007:013 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them
           that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.

33:007:014 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage,
           which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel:
           let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

33:007:015 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt
           will I shew unto him marvellous things.

33:007:016 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might:
           they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall
           be deaf.

33:007:017 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out
           of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid
           of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.

33:007:018 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and
           passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?
           he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in
           mercy.

33:007:019 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will
           subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into
           the depths of the sea.

33:007:020 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to
           Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days
           of old.

Book 34        Nahum

34:001:001 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the
           Elkoshite.

34:001:002 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth,
           and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his
           adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.

34:001:003 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at
           all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind
           and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

34:001:004 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
           rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of
           Lebanon languisheth.

34:001:005 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth
           is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell
           therein.

34:001:006 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
           fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and
           the rocks are thrown down by him.

34:001:007 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
           knoweth them that trust in him.

34:001:008 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the
           place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

34:001:009 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter
           end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.

34:001:010 For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they
           are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble
           fully dry.

34:001:011 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the
           LORD, a wicked counsellor.

34:001:012 Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many,
           yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through.
           Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.

34:001:013 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst
           thy bonds in sunder.

34:001:014 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no
           more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I
           cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy
           grave; for thou art vile.

34:001:015 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
           tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn
           feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass
           through thee; he is utterly cut off.

34:002:001 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the
           munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy
           power mightily.

34:002:002 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the
           excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out,
           and marred their vine branches.

34:002:003 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are
           in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the
           day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly
           shaken.

34:002:004 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one
           against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like
           torches, they shall run like the lightnings.

34:002:005 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their
           walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the
           defence shall be prepared.

34:002:006 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall
           be dissolved.

34:002:007 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up,
           and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves,
           tabering upon their breasts.

34:002:008 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall
           flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look
           back.

34:002:009 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there
           is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant
           furniture.

34:002:010 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and
           the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and
           the faces of them all gather blackness.

34:002:011 Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of
           the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked,
           and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?

34:002:012 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and
           strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey,
           and his dens with ravin.

34:002:013 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will
           burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy
           young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and
           the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.

34:003:001 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery;
           the prey departeth not;

34:003:002 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the
           wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping
           chariots.

34:003:003 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the
           glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a
           great number of carcases; and there is none end of their
           corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:

34:003:004 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured
           harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations
           through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

34:003:005 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will
           discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations
           thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

34:003:006 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee
           vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.

34:003:007 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee
           shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will
           bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?

34:003:008 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the
           rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was
           the sea, and her wall was from the sea?

34:003:009 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put
           and Lubim were thy helpers.

34:003:010 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
           children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the
           streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all
           her great men were bound in chains.

34:003:011 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt
           seek strength because of the enemy.

34:003:012 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the
           firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into
           the mouth of the eater.

34:003:013 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates
           of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the
           fire shall devour thy bars.

34:003:014 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go
           into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.

34:003:015 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee
           off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself
           many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.

34:003:016 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven:
           the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.

34:003:017 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
           grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but
           when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not
           known where they are.

34:003:018 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall
           dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains,
           and no man gathereth them.

34:003:019 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all
           that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee:
           for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?

Book 35        Habakkuk

35:001:001 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

35:001:002 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry
           out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!

35:001:003 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold
           grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there
           are that raise up strife and contention.

35:001:004 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go
           forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
           therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

35:001:005 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder
           marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will
           not believe, though it be told you.

35:001:006 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
           nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to
           possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's.

35:001:007 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
           dignity shall proceed of themselves.

35:001:008 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more
           fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall
           spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far;
           they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.

35:001:009 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as
           the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the
           sand.

35:001:010 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a
           scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they
           shall heap dust, and take it.

35:001:011 Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and
           offend, imputing this his power unto his god.

35:001:012 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
           we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for
           judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for
           correction.

35:001:013 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look
           on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
           treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked
           devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?

35:001:014 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping
           things, that have no ruler over them?

35:001:015 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in
           their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they
           rejoice and are glad.

35:001:016 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto
           their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their
           meat plenteous.

35:001:017 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare
           continually to slay the nations?

35:002:001 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and
           will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall
           answer when I am reproved.

35:002:002 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make
           it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

35:002:003 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it
           shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;
           because it will surely come, it will not tarry.

35:002:004 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but
           the just shall live by his faith.

35:002:005 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,
           neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and
           is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him
           all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:

35:002:006 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a
           taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that
           increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that
           ladeth himself with thick clay!

35:002:007 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and
           awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto
           them?

35:002:008 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the
           people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the
           violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell
           therein.

35:002:009 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,
           that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered
           from the power of evil!

35:002:010 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many
           people, and hast sinned against thy soul.

35:002:011 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of
           the timber shall answer it.

35:002:012 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a
           city by iniquity!

35:002:013 Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall
           labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves
           for very vanity?

35:002:014 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory
           of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

35:002:015 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy
           bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest
           look on their nakedness!

35:002:016 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let
           thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand
           shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on
           thy glory.

35:002:017 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
           beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and
           for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that
           dwell therein.

35:002:018 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
           graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the
           maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?

35:002:019 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone,
           Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and
           silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

35:002:020 But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep
           silence before him.

35:003:001 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

35:003:002 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD,
           revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the
           years make known; in wrath remember mercy.

35:003:003 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.
           His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his
           praise.

35:003:004 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out
           of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.

35:003:005 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth
           at his feet.

35:003:006 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder
           the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the
           perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.

35:003:007 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of
           the land of Midian did tremble.

35:003:008 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger
           against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou
           didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?

35:003:009 Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the
           tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with
           rivers.

35:003:010 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of
           the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up
           his hands on high.

35:003:011 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light
           of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy
           glittering spear.

35:003:012 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst
           thresh the heathen in anger.

35:003:013 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
           salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of
           the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto
           the neck. Selah.

35:003:014 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his
           villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their
           rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.

35:003:015 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the
           heap of great waters.

35:003:016 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the
           voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in
           myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he
           cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his
           troops.

35:003:017 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit
           be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the
           fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from
           the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:

35:003:018 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my
           salvation.

35:003:019 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like
           hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high
           places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

Book 36        Zephaniah

36:001:001 The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of
           Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of
           Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

36:001:002 I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the
           LORD.

36:001:003 I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the
           heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks
           with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land,
           saith the LORD.

36:001:004 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the
           inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of
           Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the
           priests;

36:001:005 And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops;
           and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that
           swear by Malcham;

36:001:006 And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that
           have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.

36:001:007 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of
           the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice,
           he hath bid his guests.

36:001:008 And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice,
           that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and
           all such as are clothed with strange apparel.

36:001:009 In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the
           threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and
           deceit.

36:001:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that
           there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an
           howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.

36:001:011 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people
           are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

36:001:012 And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search
           Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on
           their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do
           good, neither will he do evil.

36:001:013 Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a
           desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit
           them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine
           thereof.

36:001:014 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth
           greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man
           shall cry there bitterly.

36:001:015 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a
           day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and
           gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,

36:001:016 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and
           against the high towers.

36:001:017 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like
           blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and
           their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as
           the dung.

36:001:018 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver
           them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall
           be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make
           even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.

36:002:001 Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
           desired;

36:002:002 Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the
           chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you,
           before the day of the LORD's anger come upon you.

36:002:003 Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought
           his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye
           shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger.

36:002:004 For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they
           shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be
           rooted up.

36:002:005 Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the
           Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan,
           the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that
           there shall be no inhabitant.

36:002:006 And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for
           shepherds, and folds for flocks.

36:002:007 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah;
           they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall
           they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall
           visit them, and turn away their captivity.

36:002:008 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the
           children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and
           magnified themselves against their border.

36:002:009 Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
           Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of
           Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits,
           and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall
           spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.

36:002:010 This shall they have for their pride, because they have
           reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the
           LORD of hosts.

36:002:011 The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all
           the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one
           from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.

36:002:012 Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.

36:002:013 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and
           destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry
           like a wilderness.

36:002:014 And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts
           of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge
           in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the
           windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall
           uncover the cedar work.

36:002:015 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in
           her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she
           become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every
           one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

36:003:001 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing
           city!

36:003:002 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she
           trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

36:003:003 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are
           evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

36:003:004 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests
           have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the
           law.

36:003:005 The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do
           iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light,
           he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.

36:003:006 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made
           their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are
           destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none
           inhabitant.

36:003:007 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive
           instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off,
           howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted
           all their doings.

36:003:008 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that
           I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the
           nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them
           mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth
           shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.

36:003:009 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they
           may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one
           consent.

36:003:010 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the
           daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.

36:003:011 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings,
           wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will
           take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy
           pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy
           mountain.

36:003:012 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
           people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

36:003:013 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies;
           neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for
           they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

36:003:014 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice
           with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

36:003:015 The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine
           enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of
           thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.

36:003:016 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and
           to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.

36:003:017 The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save,
           he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love,
           he will joy over thee with singing.

36:003:018 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,
           who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.

36:003:019 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I
           will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven
           out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where
           they have been put to shame.

36:003:020 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I
           gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all
           people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before
           your eyes, saith the LORD.

Book 37        Haggai

37:001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
           the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by
           Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
           governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high
           priest, saying,

37:001:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The
           time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be
           built.

37:001:003 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

37:001:004 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and
           this house lie waste?

37:001:005 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
           ways.

37:001:006 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have
           not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye
           clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages
           earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.

37:001:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

37:001:008 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house;
           and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith
           the LORD.

37:001:009 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye
           brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of
           hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every
           man unto his own house.

37:001:010 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the
           earth is stayed from her fruit.

37:001:011 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
           mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon
           the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and
           upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
           hands.

37:001:012 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
           Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
           obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of
           Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and
           the people did fear before the LORD.

37:001:013 Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message
           unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

37:001:014 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
           Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son
           of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
           remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house
           of the LORD of hosts, their God,

37:001:015 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the
           second year of Darius the king.

37:002:001 In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the
           month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai,
           saying,

37:002:002 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
           Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and
           to the residue of the people, saying,

37:002:003 Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory?
           and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison
           of it as nothing?

37:002:004 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be
           strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be
           strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work:
           for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:

37:002:005 According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came
           out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

37:002:006 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little
           while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
           sea, and the dry land;

37:002:007 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
           shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the
           LORD of hosts.

37:002:008 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of
           hosts.

37:002:009 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the
           former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give
           peace, saith the LORD of hosts.

37:002:010 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the
           second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the
           prophet, saying,

37:002:011 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning
           the law, saying,

37:002:012 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with
           his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any
           meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

37:002:013 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch
           any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered
           and said, It shall be unclean.

37:002:014 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is
           this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of
           their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.

37:002:015 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from
           before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the
           LORD:

37:002:016 Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty
           measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat
           for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but
           twenty.

37:002:017 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all
           the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the
           LORD.

37:002:018 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and
           twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the
           foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.

37:002:019 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig
           tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not
           brought forth: from this day will I bless you.

37:002:020 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four
           and twentieth day of the month, saying,

37:002:021 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake
           the heavens and the earth;

37:002:022 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will
           destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I
           will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and
           the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the
           sword of his brother.

37:002:023 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O
           Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD,
           and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith
           the LORD of hosts.

Book 38        Zechariah

38:001:001 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the
           word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
           of Iddo the prophet, saying,

38:001:002 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.

38:001:003 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
           Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto
           you, saith the LORD of hosts.

38:001:004 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have
           cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from
           your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not
           hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.

38:001:005 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live
           for ever?

38:001:006 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants
           the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they
           returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do
           unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings,
           so hath he dealt with us.

38:001:007 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which
           is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the
           word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
           of Iddo the prophet, saying,

38:001:008 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and
           he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and
           behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.

38:001:009 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that
           talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.

38:001:010 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and
           said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and
           fro through the earth.

38:001:011 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the
           myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the
           earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at
           rest.

38:001:012 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts,
           how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the
           cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these
           threescore and ten years?

38:001:013 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good
           words and comfortable words.

38:001:014 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
           saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for
           Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

38:001:015 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at
           ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped
           forward the affliction.

38:001:016 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with
           mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of
           hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.

38:001:017 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities
           through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD
           shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

38:001:018 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.

38:001:019 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these?
           And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered
           Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

38:001:020 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.

38:001:021 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying,
           These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man
           did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast
           out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over
           the land of Judah to scatter it.

38:002:001 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with
           a measuring line in his hand.

38:002:002 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To
           measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and
           what is the length thereof.

38:002:003 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and
           another angel went out to meet him,

38:002:004 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,
           Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the
           multitude of men and cattle therein:

38:002:005 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round
           about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.

38:002:006 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith
           the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of
           the heaven, saith the LORD.

38:002:007 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of
           Babylon.

38:002:008 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent
           me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth
           you toucheth the apple of his eye.

38:002:009 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall
           be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD
           of hosts hath sent me.

38:002:010 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I
           will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.

38:002:011 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and
           shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and
           thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.

38:002:012 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,
           and shall choose Jerusalem again.

38:002:013 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up
           out of his holy habitation.

38:003:001 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the
           angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to
           resist him.

38:003:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan;
           even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not
           this a brand plucked out of the fire?

38:003:003 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before
