           other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.

48:005:018 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

48:005:019 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
           Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

48:005:020 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
           strife, seditions, heresies,

48:005:021 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of
           the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
           past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the
           kingdom of God.

48:005:022 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
           longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,

48:005:023 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

48:005:024 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
           affections and lusts.

48:005:025 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

48:005:026 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
           envying one another.

48:006:001 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
           spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
           considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

48:006:002 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of
           Christ.

48:006:003 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is
           nothing, he deceiveth himself.

48:006:004 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
           rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

48:006:005 For every man shall bear his own burden.

48:006:006 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
           teacheth in all good things.

48:006:007 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man
           soweth, that shall he also reap.

48:006:008 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
           corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the
           Spirit reap life everlasting.

48:006:009 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we
           shall reap, if we faint not.

48:006:010 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
           especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

48:006:011 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine
           own hand.

48:006:012 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
           constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer
           persecution for the cross of Christ.

48:006:013 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law;
           but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in
           your flesh.

48:006:014 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
           Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and
           I unto the world.

48:006:015 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing,
           nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

48:006:016 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them,
           and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

48:006:017 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body
           the marks of the Lord Jesus.

48:006:018 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your
           spirit. Amen.

Book 49        Ephesians

49:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
           saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ
           Jesus:

49:001:002 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the
           Lord Jesus Christ.

49:001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
           hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
           places in Christ:

49:001:004 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
           the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him
           in love:

49:001:005 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

49:001:006 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made
           us accepted in the beloved.

49:001:007 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
           of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

49:001:008 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

49:001:009 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according
           to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:

49:001:010 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might
           gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
           heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:

49:001:011 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
           predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all
           things after the counsel of his own will:

49:001:012 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first
           trusted in Christ.

49:001:013 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of
           truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that
           ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,

49:001:014 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
           of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

49:001:015 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord
           Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

49:001:016 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my
           prayers;

49:001:017 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
           may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
           knowledge of him:

49:001:018 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may
           know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of
           the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

49:001:019 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward
           who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

49:001:020 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead,
           and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

49:001:021 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and
           dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
           world, but also in that which is to come:

49:001:022 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the
           head over all things to the church,

49:001:023 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

49:002:001 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
           sins;

49:002:002 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
           world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the
           spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:

49:002:003 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
           the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh
           and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath,
           even as others.

49:002:004 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
           loved us,

49:002:005 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
           with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)

49:002:006 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in
           heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

49:002:007 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of
           his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

49:002:008 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
           yourselves: it is the gift of God:

49:002:009 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

49:002:010 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
           works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in
           them.

49:002:011 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
           flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called
           the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;

49:002:012 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from
           the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
           of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:

49:002:013 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made
           nigh by the blood of Christ.

49:002:014 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken
           down the middle wall of partition between us;

49:002:015 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
           commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself
           of twain one new man, so making peace;

49:002:016 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the
           cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

49:002:017 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to
           them that were nigh.

49:002:018 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
           Father.

49:002:019 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
           fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

49:002:020 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
           prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

49:002:021 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an
           holy temple in the Lord:

49:002:022 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God
           through the Spirit.

49:003:001 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
           Gentiles,

49:003:002 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which
           is given me to you-ward:

49:003:003 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as
           I wrote afore in few words,

49:003:004 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the
           mystery of Christ)

49:003:005 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,
           as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by
           the Spirit;

49:003:006 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body,
           and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

49:003:007 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the
           grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his
           power.

49:003:008 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this
           grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the
           unsearchable riches of Christ;

49:003:009 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,
           which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,
           who created all things by Jesus Christ:

49:003:010 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in
           heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold
           wisdom of God,

49:003:011 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ
           Jesus our Lord:

49:003:012 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the
           faith of him.

49:003:013 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for
           you, which is your glory.

49:003:014 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord
           Jesus Christ,

49:003:015 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

49:003:016 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
           to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

49:003:017 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being
           rooted and grounded in love,

49:003:018 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth,
           and length, and depth, and height;

49:003:019 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that
           ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

49:003:020 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
           that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in
           us,

49:003:021 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all
           ages, world without end. Amen.

49:004:001 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye
           walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,

49:004:002 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering,
           forbearing one another in love;

49:004:003 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
           peace.

49:004:004 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in
           one hope of your calling;

49:004:005 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

49:004:006 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all,
           and in you all.

49:004:007 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the
           measure of the gift of Christ.

49:004:008 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led
           captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

49:004:009 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
           first into the lower parts of the earth?

49:004:010 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above
           all heavens, that he might fill all things.)

49:004:011 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
           evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

49:004:012 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
           ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

49:004:013 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
           knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
           measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

49:004:014 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
           carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of
           men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
           deceive;

49:004:015 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
           things, which is the head, even Christ:

49:004:016 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
           by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
           effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh
           increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.

49:004:017 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye
           henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of
           their mind,

49:004:018 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
           life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of
           the blindness of their heart:

49:004:019 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto
           lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

49:004:020 But ye have not so learned Christ;

49:004:021 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him,
           as the truth is in Jesus:

49:004:022 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old
           man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;

49:004:023 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

49:004:024 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
           righteousness and true holiness.

49:004:025 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
           neighbour: for we are members one of another.

49:004:026 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
           wrath:

49:004:027 Neither give place to the devil.

49:004:028 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
           working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may
           have to give to him that needeth.

49:004:029 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but
           that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may
           minister grace unto the hearers.

49:004:030 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
           unto the day of redemption.

49:004:031 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and
           evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:

49:004:032 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
           another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

49:005:001 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

49:005:002 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
           himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
           sweetsmelling savour.

49:005:003 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it
           not be once named among you, as becometh saints;

49:005:004 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which
           are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

49:005:005 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
           covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the
           kingdom of Christ and of God.

49:005:006 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
           things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
           disobedience.

49:005:007 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

49:005:008 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the
           Lord: walk as children of light:

49:005:009 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
           righteousness and truth;)

49:005:010 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

49:005:011 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
           but rather reprove them.

49:005:012 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done
           of them in secret.

49:005:013 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the
           light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

49:005:014 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from
           the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

49:005:015 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as
           wise,

49:005:016 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

49:005:017 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of
           the Lord is.

49:005:018 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
           with the Spirit;

49:005:019 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
           songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

49:005:020 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
           the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

49:005:021 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

49:005:022 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
           Lord.

49:005:023 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
           head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

49:005:024 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the
           wives be to their own husbands in every thing.

49:005:025 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
           church, and gave himself for it;

49:005:026 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
           water by the word,

49:005:027 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
           having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should
           be holy and without blemish.

49:005:028 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
           loveth his wife loveth himself.

49:005:029 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
           cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

49:005:030 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
           bones.

49:005:031 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
           shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one
           flesh.

49:005:032 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
           church.

49:005:033 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his
           wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her
           husband.

49:006:001 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

49:006:002 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment
           with promise;

49:006:003 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on
           the earth.

49:006:004 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
           them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

49:006:005 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according
           to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your
           heart, as unto Christ;

49:006:006 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of
           Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

49:006:007 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

49:006:008 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same
           shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

49:006:009 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
           threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven;
           neither is there respect of persons with him.

49:006:010 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power
           of his might.

49:006:011 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
           against the wiles of the devil.

49:006:012 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
           principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
           darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
           places.

49:006:013 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may
           be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
           stand.

49:006:014 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
           having on the breastplate of righteousness;

49:006:015 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of
           peace;

49:006:016 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be
           able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

49:006:017 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
           which is the word of God:

49:006:018 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,
           and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication
           for all saints;

49:006:019 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may
           open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

49:006:020 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may
           speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

49:006:021 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus,
           a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall
           make known to you all things:

49:006:022 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might
           know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

49:006:023 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
           Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

49:006:024 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
           sincerity. Amen.

Book 50        Philippians

50:001:001 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
           saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops
           and deacons:

50:001:002 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from
           the Lord Jesus Christ.

50:001:003 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

50:001:004 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with
           joy,

50:001:005 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until
           now;

50:001:006 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a
           good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
           Christ:

50:001:007 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I
           have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the
           defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers
           of my grace.

50:001:008 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
           bowels of Jesus Christ.

50:001:009 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more
           in knowledge and in all judgment;

50:001:010 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be
           sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.

50:001:011 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by
           Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

50:001:012 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things
           which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the
           furtherance of the gospel;

50:001:013 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and
           in all other places;

50:001:014 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my
           bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

50:001:015 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some
           also of good will:

50:001:016 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing
           to add affliction to my bonds:

50:001:017 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence
           of the gospel.

50:001:018 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or
           in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea,
           and will rejoice.

50:001:019 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
           prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

50:001:020 According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in
           nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as
           always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body,
           whether it be by life, or by death.

50:001:021 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

50:001:022 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour:
           yet what I shall choose I wot not.

50:001:023 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
           and to be with Christ; which is far better:

50:001:024 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.

50:001:025 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and
           continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;

50:001:026 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for
           me by my coming to you again.

50:001:027 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
           Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I
           may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit,
           with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;

50:001:028 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them
           an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and
           that of God.

50:001:029 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
           believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;

50:001:030 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to
           be in me.

50:002:001 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any
           comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
           bowels and mercies,

50:002:002 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,
           being of one accord, of one mind.

50:002:003 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in
           lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than
           themselves.

50:002:004 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on
           the things of others.

50:002:005 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

50:002:006 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
           equal with God:

50:002:007 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
           of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

50:002:008 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
           became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

50:002:009 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
           name which is above every name:

50:002:010 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in
           heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;

50:002:011 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
           Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

50:002:012 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
           presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your
           own salvation with fear and trembling.

50:002:013 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
           his good pleasure.

50:002:014 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:

50:002:015 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God,
           without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
           among whom ye shine as lights in the world;

50:002:016 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day
           of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in
           vain.

50:002:017 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of
           your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

50:002:018 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

50:002:019 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto
           you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your
           state.

50:002:020 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
           state.

50:002:021 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
           Christ's.

50:002:022 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father,
           he hath served with me in the gospel.

50:002:023 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see
           how it will go with me.

50:002:024 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.

50:002:025 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
           brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your
           messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

50:002:026 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness,
           because that ye had heard that he had been sick.

50:002:027 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on
           him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have
           sorrow upon sorrow.

50:002:028 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
           again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

50:002:029 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
           such in reputation:

50:002:030 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not
           regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

50:003:001 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
           things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is
           safe.

50:003:002 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the
           concision.

50:003:003 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit,
           and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the
           flesh.

50:003:004 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other
           man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh,
           I more:

50:003:005 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the
           tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the
           law, a Pharisee;

50:003:006 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
           righteousness which is in the law, blameless.

50:003:007 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
           Christ.

50:003:008 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
           excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom
           I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but
           dung, that I may win Christ,

50:003:009 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which
           is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,
           the righteousness which is of God by faith:

50:003:010 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
           the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto
           his death;

50:003:011 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the
           dead.

50:003:012 Not as though I had already attained, either were already
           perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for
           which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

50:003:013 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
           thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
           reaching forth unto those things which are before,

50:003:014 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of
           God in Christ Jesus.

50:003:015 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and
           if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
           this unto you.

50:003:016 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
           the same rule, let us mind the same thing.

50:003:017 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which
           walk so as ye have us for an ensample.

50:003:018 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
           you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of
           Christ:

50:003:019 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose
           glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

50:003:020 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
           for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

50:003:021 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
           unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is
           able even to subdue all things unto himself.

50:004:001 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy
           and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.

50:004:002 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the
           same mind in the Lord.

50:004:003 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women
           which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and
           with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of
           life.

50:004:004 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

50:004:005 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at
           hand.

50:004:006 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
           supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known
           unto God.

50:004:007 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
           keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

50:004:008 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
           things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
           things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
           things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if
           there be any praise, think on these things.

50:004:009 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and
           heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with
           you.

50:004:010 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
           care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also
           careful, but ye lacked opportunity.

50:004:011 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
           whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

50:004:012 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
           where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to
           be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

50:004:013 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

50:004:014 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate
           with my affliction.

50:004:015 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
           gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated
           with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

50:004:016 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
           necessity.

50:004:017 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may
           abound to your account.

50:004:018 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
           Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of
           a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

50:004:019 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches
           in glory by Christ Jesus.

50:004:020 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

50:004:021 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are
           with me greet you.

50:004:022 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's
           household.

50:004:023 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Book 51        Colossians

51:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
           Timotheus our brother,

51:001:002 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at
           Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and
           the Lord Jesus Christ.

51:001:003 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
           praying always for you,

51:001:004 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
           which ye have to all the saints,

51:001:005 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye
           heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

51:001:006 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and
           bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye
           heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:

51:001:007 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is
           for you a faithful minister of Christ;

51:001:008 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

51:001:009 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not
           cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled
           with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
           understanding;

51:001:010 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
           fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge
           of God;

51:001:011 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power,
           unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

51:001:012 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
           partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

51:001:013 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
           translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

51:001:014 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the
           forgiveness of sins:

51:001:015 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
           creature:

51:001:016 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
           that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
           thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all
           things were created by him, and for him:

51:001:017 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

51:001:018 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the
           beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he
           might have the preeminence.

51:001:019 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness
           dwell;

51:001:020 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him
           to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether
           they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

51:001:021 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind
           by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

51:001:022 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy
           and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

51:001:023 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not
           moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,
           and which was preached to every creature which is under
           heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;

51:001:024 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that
           which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
           his body's sake, which is the church:

51:001:025 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of
           God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;

51:001:026 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from
           generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:

51:001:027 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory
           of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you,
           the hope of glory:

51:001:028 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in
           all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ
           Jesus:

51:001:029 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working,
           which worketh in me mightily.

51:002:001 For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you,
           and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my
           face in the flesh;

51:002:002 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in
           love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of
           understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God,
           and of the Father, and of Christ;

51:002:003 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

51:002:004 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing
           words.

51:002:005 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
           spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness
           of your faith in Christ.

51:002:006 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
           ye in him:

51:002:007 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye
           have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

51:002:008 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain
           deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the
           world, and not after Christ.

51:002:009 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

51:002:010 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all
           principality and power:

51:002:011 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made
           without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the
           flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

51:002:012 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
           through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him
           from the dead.

51:002:013 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of
           your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having
           forgiven you all trespasses;

51:002:014 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
           us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
           nailing it to his cross;

51:002:015 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew
           of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

51:002:016 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in
           respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath
           days:

51:002:017 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of
           Christ.

51:002:018 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility
           and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which
           he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

51:002:019 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints
           and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together,
           increaseth with the increase of God.

51:002:020 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the
           world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to
           ordinances,

51:002:021 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;

51:002:022 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the
           commandments and doctrines of men?

51:002:023 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
           humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the
           satisfying of the flesh.

51:003:001 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
           above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

51:003:002 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the
           earth.

51:003:003 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

51:003:004 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
           appear with him in glory.

51:003:005 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
           fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil
           concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:

51:003:006 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children
           of disobedience:

51:003:007 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

51:003:008 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice,
           blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

51:003:009 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old
           man with his deeds;

51:003:010 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge
           after the image of him that created him:

51:003:011 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
           uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ
           is all, and in all.

51:003:012 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,
           bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
           longsuffering;

51:003:013 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man
           have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so
           also do ye.

51:003:014 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond
           of perfectness.

51:003:015 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which
           also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

51:003:016 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;
           teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and
           spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
           Lord.

51:003:017 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of
           the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

51:003:018 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit
           in the Lord.

51:003:019 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.

51:003:020 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well
           pleasing unto the Lord.

51:003:021 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
           discouraged.

51:003:022 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the
           flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness
           of heart, fearing God;

51:003:023 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not
           unto men;

51:003:024 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
           inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

51:003:025 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he
           hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

51:004:001 Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal;
           knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.

51:004:002 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

51:004:003 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door
           of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am
           also in bonds:

51:004:004 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

51:004:005 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the
           time.

51:004:006 Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that
           ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

51:004:007 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved
           brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the
           Lord:

51:004:008 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might
           know your estate, and comfort your hearts;

51:004:009 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of
           you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done
           here.

51:004:010 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus,
           sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received
           commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)

51:004:011 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the
           circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom
           of God, which have been a comfort unto me.

51:004:012 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth
           you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye
           may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

51:004:013 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and
           them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

51:004:014 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

51:004:015 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and
           the church which is in his house.

51:004:016 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read
           also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise
           read the epistle from Laodicea.

51:004:017 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou
           hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

51:004:018 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds.
           Grace be with you. Amen.

Book 52        1 Thessalonians

52:001:001 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
           Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus
           Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and
           the Lord Jesus Christ.

52:001:002 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of
           you in our prayers;

52:001:003 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of
           love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
           sight of God and our Father;

52:001:004 Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.

52:001:005 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in
           power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye
           know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

52:001:006 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having
           received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy
           Ghost.

52:001:007 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
           Achaia.

52:001:008 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
           Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to
           God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any
           thing.

52:001:009 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we
           had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the
           living and true God;

52:001:010 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
           dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

52:002:001 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
           it was not in vain:

52:002:002 But even after that we had suffered before, and were
           shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in
           our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much
           contention.

52:002:003 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor
           in guile:

52:002:004 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the
           gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which
           trieth our hearts.

52:002:005 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know,
           nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:

52:002:006 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others,
           when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.

52:002:007 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
           children:

52:002:008 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to
           have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also
           our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.

52:002:009 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for
           labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable
           unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.

52:002:010 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
           unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:

52:002:011 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one
           of you, as a father doth his children,

52:002:012 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his
           kingdom and glory.

52:002:013 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
           when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye
           received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the
           word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
           believe.

52:002:014 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God
           which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered
           like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the
           Jews:

52:002:015 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and
           have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary
           to all men:

52:002:016 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be
           saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon
           them to the uttermost.

52:002:017 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
           presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see
           your face with great desire.

52:002:018 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
           again; but Satan hindered us.

52:002:019 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not
           even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his
           coming?

52:002:020 For ye are our glory and joy.

52:003:001 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good
           to be left at Athens alone;

52:003:002 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
           fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and
           to comfort you concerning your faith:

52:003:003 That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for
           yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

52:003:004 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
           should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye
           know.

52:003:005 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
           your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you,
           and our labour be in vain.

52:003:006 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us
           good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good
           remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we
           also to see you:

52:003:007 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
           affliction and distress by your faith:

52:003:008 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.

52:003:009 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all
           the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;

52:003:010 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face,
           and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

52:003:011 Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
           direct our way unto you.

52:003:012 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one
           toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:

52:003:013 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness
           before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
           Christ with all his saints.

52:004:001 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by
           the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to
           walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.

52:004:002 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

52:004:003 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
           should abstain from fornication:

52:004:004 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
           sanctification and honour;

52:004:005 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
           know not God:

52:004:006 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter:
           because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also
           have forewarned you and testified.

52:004:007 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto
           holiness.

52:004:008 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
           hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.

52:004:009 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
           you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

52:004:010 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
           Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more
           and more;

52:004:011 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
           and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

52:004:012 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
           that ye may have lack of nothing.

52:004:013 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
           them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others
           which have no hope.

52:004:014 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
           also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

52:004:015 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
           which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
           not prevent them which are asleep.

52:004:016 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
           with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God:
           and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

52:004:017 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
           with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
           shall we ever be with the Lord.

52:004:018 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

52:005:001 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need
           that I write unto you.

52:005:002 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
           cometh as a thief in the night.

52:005:003 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
           destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with
           child; and they shall not escape.

52:005:004 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
           overtake you as a thief.

52:005:005 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day:
           we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

52:005:006 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and
           be sober.

52:005:007 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be
           drunken are drunken in the night.

52:005:008 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
           breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of
           salvation.

52:005:009 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
           salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,

52:005:010 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should
           live together with him.

52:005:011 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
           even as also ye do.

52:005:012 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
           you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;

52:005:013 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.
           And be at peace among yourselves.

52:005:014 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly,
           comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward
           all men.

52:005:015 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever
           follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all
           men.

52:005:016 Rejoice evermore.

52:005:017 Pray without ceasing.

52:005:018 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in
           Christ Jesus concerning you.

52:005:019 Quench not the Spirit.

52:005:020 Despise not prophesyings.

52:005:021 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

52:005:022 Abstain from all appearance of evil.

52:005:023 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
           your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
           unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

52:005:024 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

52:005:025 Brethren, pray for us.

52:005:026 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

52:005:027 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all
           the holy brethren.

52:005:028 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

Book 53        2 Thessalonians

53:001:001 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
           Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

53:001:002 Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
           Jesus Christ.

53:001:003 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is
           meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the
           charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;

53:001:004 So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for
           your patience and faith in all your persecutions and
           tribulations that ye endure:

53:001:005 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
           that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
           ye also suffer:

53:001:006 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
           tribulation to them that trouble you;

53:001:007 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
           shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,

53:001:008 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God,
           and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

53:001:009 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
           presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

53:001:010 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
           admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among
           you was believed) in that day.

53:001:011 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would
           count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good
           pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:

53:001:012 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in
           you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the
           Lord Jesus Christ.

53:002:001 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
           Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,

53:002:002 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by
           spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day
           of Christ is at hand.

53:002:003 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not
           come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of
           sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

53:002:004 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
           God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the
           temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.

53:002:005 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you
           these things?

53:002:006 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in
           his time.

53:002:007 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
           letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

53:002:008 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
           consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with
           the brightness of his coming:

53:002:009 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all
           power and signs and lying wonders,

53:002:010 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that
           perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that
           they might be saved.

53:002:011 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
           they should believe a lie:

53:002:012 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but
           had pleasure in unrighteousness.

53:002:013 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
           beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
           chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit
           and belief of the truth:

53:002:014 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the
           glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

53:002:015 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which
           ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

53:002:016 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
           which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation
           and good hope through grace,

53:002:017 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
           work.

53:003:001 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may
           have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:

53:003:002 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men:
           for all men have not faith.

53:003:003 But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
           from evil.

53:003:004 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both
           do and will do the things which we command you.

53:003:005 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into
           the patient waiting for Christ.

53:003:006 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
           Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that
           walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he
           received of us.

53:003:007 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved
           not ourselves disorderly among you;

53:003:008 Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought
           with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be
           chargeable to any of you:

53:003:009 Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an
           ensample unto you to follow us.

53:003:010 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if
           any would not work, neither should he eat.

53:003:011 For we hear that there are some which walk among you
           disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.

53:003:012 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
           Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own
           bread.

53:003:013 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

53:003:014 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
           man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.

53:003:015 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

53:003:016 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all
           means. The Lord be with you all.

53:003:017 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
           in every epistle: so I write.

53:003:018 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Book 54        1 Timothy

54:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
           Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;

54:001:002 Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and
           peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

54:001:003 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
           Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no
           other doctrine,

54:001:004 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which
           minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in
           faith: so do.

54:001:005 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart,
           and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:

54:001:006 From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain
           jangling;

54:001:007 Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what
           they say, nor whereof they affirm.

54:001:008 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;

54:001:009 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man,
           but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for
           sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
           murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

54:001:010 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with
           mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and
           if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound
           doctrine;

54:001:011 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was
           committed to my trust.

54:001:012 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for
           that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;

54:001:013 Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious:
           but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

54:001:014 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith
           and love which is in Christ Jesus.

54:001:015 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
           Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am
           chief.

54:001:016 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first
           Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern
           to them which should hereafter believe on him to life
           everlasting.

54:001:017 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
           God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

54:001:018 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
           prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them
           mightest war a good warfare;

54:001:019 Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
           away concerning faith have made shipwreck:

54:001:020 Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto
           Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

54:002:001 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications,
           prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all
           men;

54:002:002 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead
           a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

54:002:003 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
           Saviour;

54:002:004 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
           knowledge of the truth.

54:002:005 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
           the man Christ Jesus;

54:002:006 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due
           time.

54:002:007 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak
           the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles
           in faith and verity.

54:002:008 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy
           hands, without wrath and doubting.

54:002:009 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
           apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided
           hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;

54:002:010 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good
           works.

54:002:011 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

54:002:012 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over
           the man, but to be in silence.

54:002:013 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

54:002:014 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in
           the transgression.

54:002:015 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they
           continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

54:003:001 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop,
           he desireth a good work.

54:003:002 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
           vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt
           to teach;

54:003:003 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but
           patient, not a brawler, not covetous;

54:003:004 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in
           subjection with all gravity;

54:003:005 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he
           take care of the church of God?)

54:003:006 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the
           condemnation of the devil.

54:003:007 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
           lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

54:003:008 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not
           given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;

54:003:009 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

54:003:010 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the
           office of a deacon, being found blameless.

54:003:011 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
           faithful in all things.

54:003:012 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
           children and their own houses well.

54:003:013 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase
           to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith
           which is in Christ Jesus.

54:003:014 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee
           shortly:

54:003:015 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
           to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of
           the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

54:003:016 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God
           was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
           angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
           received up into glory.

54:004:001 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
           some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
           spirits, and doctrines of devils;

54:004:002 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared
           with a hot iron;

54:004:003 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,
           which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of
           them which believe and know the truth.

54:004:004 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused,
           if it be received with thanksgiving:

54:004:005 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

54:004:006 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
           shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the
           words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast
           attained.

54:004:007 But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself
           rather unto godliness.

54:004:008 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is
           profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that
           now is, and of that which is to come.

54:004:009 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.

54:004:010 For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
           trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men,
           specially of those that believe.

54:004:011 These things command and teach.

54:004:012 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
           believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
           faith, in purity.

54:004:013 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
           doctrine.

54:004:014 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
           prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

54:004:015 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that
           thy profiting may appear to all.

54:004:016 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in
           them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them
           that hear thee.

54:005:001 Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the
           younger men as brethren;

54:005:002 The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all
           purity.

54:005:003 Honour widows that are widows indeed.

54:005:004 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn
           first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for
           that is good and acceptable before God.

54:005:005 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God,
           and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

54:005:006 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

54:005:007 And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

54:005:008 But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of
           his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an
           infidel.

54:005:009 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore
           years old, having been the wife of one man.

54:005:010 Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up
           children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the
           saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have
           diligently followed every good work.

54:005:011 But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
           wanton against Christ, they will marry;

54:005:012 Having damnation, because they have cast off their first
           faith.

54:005:013 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house
           to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies,
           speaking things which they ought not.

54:005:014 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
           guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak
           reproachfully.

54:005:015 For some are already turned aside after Satan.

54:005:016 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them
           relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may
           relieve them that are widows indeed.

54:005:017 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double
           honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

54:005:018 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
           treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his
           reward.

54:005:019 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or
           three witnesses.

54:005:020 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

54:005:021 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
           elect angels, that thou observe these things without
           preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.

54:005:022 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other
           men's sins: keep thyself pure.

54:005:023 Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's
           sake and thine often infirmities.

54:005:024 Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
           and some men they follow after.

54:005:025 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand;
           and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

54:006:001 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own
           masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his
           doctrine be not blasphemed.

54:006:002 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise
           them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service,
           because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the
           benefit. These things teach and exhort.

54:006:003 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome
           words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
           doctrine which is according to godliness;

54:006:004 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and
           strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil
           surmisings,

54:006:005 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of
           the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such
           withdraw thyself.

54:006:006 But godliness with contentment is great gain.

54:006:007 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we
           can carry nothing out.

54:006:008 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

54:006:009 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare,
           and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in
           destruction and perdition.

54:006:010 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while
           some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and
           pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

54:006:011 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
           righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

54:006:012 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,
           whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good
           profession before many witnesses.

54:006:013 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all
           things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate
           witnessed a good confession;

54:006:014 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable,
           until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

54:006:015 Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only
           Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

54:006:016 Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man
           can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom
           be honour and power everlasting. Amen.

54:006:017 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
           highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living
           God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;

54:006:018 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
           distribute, willing to communicate;

54:006:019 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against
           the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

54:006:020 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
           profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely
           so called:

54:006:021 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace
           be with thee. Amen.

Book 55        2 Timothy

55:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according
           to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

55:001:002 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace,
           from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

55:001:003 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
           conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in
           my prayers night and day;

55:001:004 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that
           I may be filled with joy;

55:001:005 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in
           thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy
           mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.

55:001:006 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift
           of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

55:001:007 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power,
           and of love, and of a sound mind.

55:001:008 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
           nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the
           afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;

55:001:009 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not
           according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
           grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
           began,

55:001:010 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus
           Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and
           immortality to light through the gospel:

55:001:011 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a
           teacher of the Gentiles.

55:001:012 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I
           am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am
           persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
           unto him against that day.

55:001:013 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of
           me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

55:001:014 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
           Ghost which dwelleth in us.

55:001:015 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned
           away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

55:001:016 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
           refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:

55:001:017 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently,
           and found me.

55:001:018 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
           that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at
           Ephesus, thou knowest very well.

55:002:001 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
           Christ Jesus.

55:002:002 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many
           witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be
           able to teach others also.

55:002:003 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus
           Christ.

55:002:004 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of
           this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a
           soldier.

55:002:005 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
           except he strive lawfully.

55:002:006 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
           fruits.

55:002:007 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in
           all things.

55:002:008 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised
           from the dead according to my gospel:

55:002:009 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds;
           but the word of God is not bound.

55:002:010 Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they
           may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
           eternal glory.

55:002:011 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall
           also live with him:

55:002:012 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he
           also will deny us:

55:002:013 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny
           himself.

55:002:014 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before
           the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to
           the subverting of the hearers.

55:002:015 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that
           needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

55:002:016 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase
           unto more ungodliness.

55:002:017 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus
           and Philetus;

55:002:018 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the
           resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

55:002:019 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this
           seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one
           that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

55:002:020 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
           silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and
           some to dishonour.

55:002:021 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a
           vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use,
           and prepared unto every good work.

55:002:022 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,
           charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure
           heart.

55:002:023 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they
           do gender strifes.

55:002:024 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle
           unto all men, apt to teach, patient,

55:002:025 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
           peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of
           the truth;

55:002:026 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the
           devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.

55:003:001 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
           come.

55:003:002 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
           boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
           unthankful, unholy,

55:003:003 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,
           incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

55:003:004 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than
           lovers of God;

55:003:005 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof:
           from such turn away.

55:003:006 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
           captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers
           lusts,

55:003:007 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
           truth.

55:003:008 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also
           resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning
           the faith.

55:003:009 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
           manifest unto all men, as their's also was.

55:003:010 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
           purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

55:003:011 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at
           Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of
           them all the Lord delivered me.

55:003:012 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
           persecution.

55:003:013 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,
           deceiving, and being deceived.

55:003:014 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and
           hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;

55:003:015 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
           which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
           which is in Christ Jesus.

55:003:016 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
           profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
           instruction in righteousness:

55:003:017 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto
           all good works.

55:004:001 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
           who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and
           his kingdom;

55:004:002 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
           rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

55:004:003 For the time will come when they will not endure sound
           doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to
           themselves teachers, having itching ears;

55:004:004 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall
           be turned unto fables.

55:004:005 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
           of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

55:004:006 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
           is at hand.

55:004:007 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
           kept the faith:

55:004:008 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
           which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that
           day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
           appearing.

55:004:009 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:

55:004:010 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world,
           and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus
           unto Dalmatia.

55:004:011 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for
           he is profitable to me for the ministry.

55:004:012 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

55:004:013 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
           bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.

55:004:014 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward
           him according to his works:

55:004:015 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our
           words.

55:004:016 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook
           me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

55:004:017 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me;
           that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all
           the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth
           of the lion.

55:004:018 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
           preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for
           ever and ever. Amen.

55:004:019 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

55:004:020 Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum
           sick.

55:004:021 Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee,
           and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

55:004:022 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
           Amen.

Book 56        Titus

56:001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
           according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging
           of the truth which is after godliness;

56:001:002 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
           before the world began;

56:001:003 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching,
           which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God
           our Saviour;

56:001:004 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
           and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
           Saviour.

56:001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
           in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in
           every city, as I had appointed thee:

56:001:006 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
           children not accused of riot or unruly.

56:001:007 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
           selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not
           given to filthy lucre;

56:001:008 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
           holy, temperate;

56:001:009 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he
           may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
           the gainsayers.

56:001:010 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
           specially they of the circumcision:

56:001:011 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,
           teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

56:001:012 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
           Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

56:001:013 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
           may be sound in the faith;

56:001:014 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men,
           that turn from the truth.

56:001:015 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are
           defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind
           and conscience is defiled.

56:001:016 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
           being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work
           reprobate.

56:002:001 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

56:002:002 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
           in charity, in patience.

56:002:003 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
           holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers
           of good things;

56:002:004 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
           husbands, to love their children,

56:002:005 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
           their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

56:002:006 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

56:002:007 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in
           doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

56:002:008 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
           contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of
           you.

56:002:009 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
           please them well in all things; not answering again;

56:002:010 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
           adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

56:002:011 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
           all men,

56:002:012 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
           should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
           world;

56:002:013 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
           the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

56:002:014 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
           iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous
           of good works.

56:002:015 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
           Let no man despise thee.

56:003:001 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
           to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

56:003:002 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle,
           shewing all meekness unto all men.

56:003:003 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
           deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
           and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

56:003:004 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
           man appeared,

56:003:005 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
           according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
           regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

56:003:006 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
           Saviour;

56:003:007 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
           according to the hope of eternal life.

56:003:008 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
           affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
           be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
           profitable unto men.

56:003:009 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions,
           and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and
           vain.

56:003:010 A man that is an heretick after the first and second
           admonition reject;

56:003:011 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
           condemned of himself.

56:003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent
           to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to
           winter.

56:003:013 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey
           diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.

56:003:014 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
           uses, that they be not unfruitful.

56:003:015 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in
           the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

Book 57        Philemon

57:001:001 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother,
           unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

57:001:002 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier,
           and to the church in thy house:

57:001:003 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
           Jesus Christ.

57:001:004 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

57:001:005 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
           Jesus, and toward all saints;

57:001:006 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by
           the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in
           Christ Jesus.

57:001:007 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
           bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

57:001:008 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin
           thee that which is convenient,

57:001:009 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one
           as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

57:001:010 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
           bonds:

57:001:011 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
           profitable to thee and to me:

57:001:012 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
           mine own bowels:

57:001:013 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might
           have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

57:001:014 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
           should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

57:001:015 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
           shouldest receive him for ever;

57:001:016 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
           specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the
           flesh, and in the Lord?

57:001:017 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

57:001:018 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
           account;

57:001:019 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it:
           albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine
           own self besides.

57:001:020 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
           bowels in the Lord.

57:001:021 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
           that thou wilt also do more than I say.

57:001:022 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
           your prayers I shall be given unto you.

57:001:023 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;

57:001:024 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

57:001:025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

Book 58        Hebrews

58:001:001 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
           past unto the fathers by the prophets,

58:001:002 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
           hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
           worlds;

58:001:003 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image
           of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his
           power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the
           right hand of the Majesty on high:

58:001:004 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by
           inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.

58:001:005 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my
           Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to
           him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?

58:001:006 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the
           world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.

58:001:007 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and
           his ministers a flame of fire.

58:001:008 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
           ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy
           kingdom.

58:001:009 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
           God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
           above thy fellows.

58:001:010 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of
           the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:

58:001:011 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax
           old as doth a garment;

58:001:012 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
           changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

58:001:013 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my
           right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?

58:001:014 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
           for them who shall be heirs of salvation?

58:002:001 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
           which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.

58:002:002 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
           transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of
           reward;

58:002:003 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
           at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
           unto us by them that heard him;

58:002:004 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders,
           and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
           according to his own will?

58:002:005 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to
           come, whereof we speak.

58:002:006 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
           that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou
           visitest him?

58:002:007 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst
           him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of
           thy hands:

58:002:008 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in
           that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that
           is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put
           under him.

58:002:009 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
           for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour;
           that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

58:002:010 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are
           all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
           captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

58:002:011 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are
           all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
           brethren,

58:002:012 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst
           of the church will I sing praise unto thee.

58:002:013 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and
           the children which God hath given me.

58:002:014 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
           blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
           through death he might destroy him that had the power of
           death, that is, the devil;

58:002:015 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
           lifetime subject to bondage.

58:002:016 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
           took on him the seed of Abraham.

58:002:017 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
           his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
           priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for
           the sins of the people.

58:002:018 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able
           to succour them that are tempted.

58:003:001 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
           consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ
           Jesus;

58:003:002 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
           faithful in all his house.

58:003:003 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
           inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour
           than the house.

58:003:004 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
           things is God.

58:003:005 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant,
           for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;

58:003:006 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if
           we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm
           unto the end.

58:003:007 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his
           voice,

58:003:008 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
           temptation in the wilderness:

58:003:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works
           forty years.

58:003:010 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They
           do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.

58:003:011 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)

58:003:012 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart
           of unbelief, in departing from the living God.

58:003:013 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest
           any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

58:003:014 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning
           of our confidence stedfast unto the end;

58:003:015 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
           your hearts, as in the provocation.

58:003:016 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all
           that came out of Egypt by Moses.

58:003:017 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them
           that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?

58:003:018 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest,
           but to them that believed not?

58:003:019 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

58:004:001 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of
           entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short
           of it.

58:004:002 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but
           the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
           faith in them that heard it.

58:004:003 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As
           I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest:
           although the works were finished from the foundation of the
           world.

58:004:004 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this
           wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.

58:004:005 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.

58:004:006 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
           and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because
           of unbelief:

58:004:007 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day,
           after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear
           his voice, harden not your hearts.

58:004:008 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward
           have spoken of another day.

58:004:009 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

58:004:010 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from
           his own works, as God did from his.

58:004:011 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
           fall after the same example of unbelief.

58:004:012 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
           any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of
           soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a
           discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

58:004:013 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
           sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of
           him with whom we have to do.

58:004:014 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
           into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
           profession.

58:004:015 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
           the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted
           like as we are, yet without sin.

58:004:016 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
           may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

58:005:001 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men
           in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and
           sacrifices for sins:

58:005:002 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
           out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with
           infirmity.

58:005:003 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
           himself, to offer for sins.

58:005:004 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
           called of God, as was Aaron.

58:005:005 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high
           priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day
           have I begotten thee.

58:005:006 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
           after the order of Melchisedec.

58:005:007 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
           and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that
           was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he
           feared;

58:005:008 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
           which he suffered;

58:005:009 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
           salvation unto all them that obey him;

58:005:010 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.

58:005:011 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
           seeing ye are dull of hearing.

58:005:012 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
           that one teach you again which be the first principles of the
           oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and
           not of strong meat.

58:005:013 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
           righteousness: for he is a babe.

58:005:014 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
           those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to
           discern both good and evil.

58:006:001 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
           let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation
           of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,

58:006:002 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of
           resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

58:006:003 And this will we do, if God permit.

58:006:004 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and
           have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of
           the Holy Ghost,

58:006:005 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
           world to come,

58:006:006 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance;
           seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and
           put him to an open shame.

58:006:007 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon
           it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is
           dressed, receiveth blessing from God:

58:006:008 But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is
           nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.

58:006:009 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and
           things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.

58:006:010 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of
           love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have
           ministered to the saints, and do minister.

58:006:011 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence
           to the full assurance of hope unto the end:

58:006:012 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through
           faith and patience inherit the promises.

58:006:013 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear
           by no greater, he sware by himself,

58:006:014 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I
           will multiply thee.

58:006:015 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the
           promise.

58:006:016 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for
           confirmation is to them an end of all strife.

58:006:017 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
           promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an
           oath:

58:006:018 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for
           God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled
           for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:

58:006:019 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
           stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;

58:006:020 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an
           high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

58:007:001 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high
           God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the
           kings, and blessed him;

58:007:002 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
           interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King
           of Salem, which is, King of peace;

58:007:003 Without father, without mother, without descent, having
           neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto
           the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

58:007:004 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the
           patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

58:007:005 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the
           office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of
           the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren,
           though they come out of the loins of Abraham:

58:007:006 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes
           of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

58:007:007 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the
           better.

58:007:008 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth
           them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

58:007:009 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed
           tithes in Abraham.

58:007:010 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec
           met him.

58:007:011 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for
           under it the people received the law,) what further need was
           there that another priest should rise after the order of
           Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

58:007:012 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a
           change also of the law.

58:007:013 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
           tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.

58:007:014 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which
           tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

58:007:015 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude
           of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

58:007:016 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but
           after the power of an endless life.

58:007:017 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order
           of Melchisedec.

58:007:018 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
           before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.

58:007:019 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a
           better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

58:007:020 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:

58:007:021 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an
           oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not
           repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
           Melchisedec:)

58:007:022 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

58:007:023 And they truly were many priests, because they were not
           suffered to continue by reason of death:

58:007:024 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable
           priesthood.

58:007:025 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
           come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
           intercession for them.

58:007:026 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
           undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
           heavens;

58:007:027 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
           sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's:
           for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

58:007:028 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but
           the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son,
           who is consecrated for evermore.

58:008:001 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We
           have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the
           throne of the Majesty in the heavens;

58:008:002 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which
           the Lord pitched, and not man.

58:008:003 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and
           sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have
           somewhat also to offer.

58:008:004 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing
           that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

58:008:005 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as
           Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the
           tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things
           according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.

58:008:006 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how
           much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was
           established upon better promises.

58:008:007 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no
           place have been sought for the second.

58:008:008 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come,
           saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house
           of Israel and with the house of Judah:

58:008:009 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
           in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of
           the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant,
           and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

58:008:010 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
           Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws
           into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be
           to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:

58:008:011 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every
           man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me,
           from the least to the greatest.

58:008:012 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their
           sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

58:008:013 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.
           Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish
           away.

58:009:001 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
           service, and a worldly sanctuary.

58:009:002 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
           candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called
           the sanctuary.

58:009:003 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
           Holiest of all;

58:009:004 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant
           overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot
           that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of
           the covenant;

58:009:005 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of
           which we cannot now speak particularly.

58:009:006 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went
           always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of
           God.

58:009:007 But into the second went the high priest alone once every
           year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for
           the errors of the people:

58:009:008 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest
           of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first
           tabernacle was yet standing:

58:009:009 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were
           offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him
           that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;

58:009:010 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and
           carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of
           reformation.

58:009:011 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come,
           by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
           that is to say, not of this building;

58:009:012 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood
           he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
           eternal redemption for us.

58:009:013 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
           heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of
           the flesh:

58:009:014 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the
           eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your
           conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

58:009:015 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
           that by means of death, for the redemption of the
           transgressions that were under the first testament, they which
           are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

58:009:016 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
           death of the testator.

58:009:017 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it
           is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.

58:009:018 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
           blood.

58:009:019 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
           according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of
           goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled
           both the book, and all the people,

58:009:020 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath
           enjoined unto you.

58:009:021 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all
           the vessels of the ministry.

58:009:022 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
           without shedding of blood is no remission.

58:009:023 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
           heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
           themselves with better sacrifices than these.

58:009:024 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with
           hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven
           itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:

58:009:025 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
           entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;

58:009:026 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of
           the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he
           appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

58:009:027 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
           the judgment:

58:009:028 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
           them that look for him shall he appear the second time without
           sin unto salvation.

58:010:001 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not
           the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
           which they offered year by year continually make the comers
           thereunto perfect.

58:010:002 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because
           that the worshippers once purged should have had no more
           conscience of sins.

58:010:003 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of
           sins every year.

58:010:004 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
           should take away sins.

58:010:005 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
           and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared
           me:

58:010:006 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no
           pleasure.

58:010:007 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is
           written of me,) to do thy will, O God.

58:010:008 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
           and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
           therein; which are offered by the law;

58:010:009 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away
           the first, that he may establish the second.

58:010:010 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of
           the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

58:010:011 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering
           oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away
           sins:

58:010:012 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for
           ever, sat down on the right hand of God;

58:010:013 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his
           footstool.

58:010:014 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
           sanctified.

58:010:015 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that
           he had said before,

58:010:016 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those
           days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts,
           and in their minds will I write them;

58:010:017 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

58:010:018 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for
           sin.

58:010:019 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
           by the blood of Jesus,

58:010:020 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,
           through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;

58:010:021 And having an high priest over the house of God;

58:010:022 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
           having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
           bodies washed with pure water.

58:010:023 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering;
           (for he is faithful that promised;)

58:010:024 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
           good works:

58:010:025 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
           manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the
           more, as ye see the day approaching.

58:010:026 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the
           knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for
           sins,

58:010:027 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery
           indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

58:010:028 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or
           three witnesses:

58:010:029 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought
           worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath
           counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
           sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the
           Spirit of grace?

58:010:030 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I
           will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall
           judge his people.

58:010:031 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
           God.

58:010:032 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye
           were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;

58:010:033 Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches
           and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of
           them that were so used.

58:010:034 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the
           spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in
           heaven a better and an enduring substance.

58:010:035 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
           recompence of reward.

58:010:036 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the
           will of God, ye might receive the promise.

58:010:037 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
           will not tarry.

58:010:038 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my
           soul shall have no pleasure in him.

58:010:039 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of
           them that believe to the saving of the soul.

58:011:001 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
           of things not seen.

58:011:002 For by it the elders obtained a good report.

58:011:003 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
           word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of
           things which do appear.

58:011:004 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
           Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God
           testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.

58:011:005 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death;
           and was not found, because God had translated him: for before
           his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

58:011:006 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
           cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
           rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

58:011:007 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
           moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house;
           by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
           righteousness which is by faith.

58:011:008 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place
           which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and
           he went out, not knowing whither he went.

58:011:009 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
           country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the
           heirs with him of the same promise:

58:011:010 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder
           and maker is God.

58:011:011 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive
           seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age,
           because she judged him faithful who had promised.

58:011:012 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,
           so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand
           which is by the sea shore innumerable.

58:011:013 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
           having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and
           embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and
           pilgrims on the earth.

58:011:014 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
           country.

58:011:015 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from
           whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have
           returned.

58:011:016 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
           wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he
           hath prepared for them a city.

58:011:017 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
           that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
           son,

58:011:018 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:

58:011:019 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the
           dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

58:011:020 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to
           come.

58:011:021 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
           Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.

58:011:022 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing
           of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his
           bones.

58:011:023 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his
           parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were
           not afraid of the king's commandment.

58:011:024 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be
           called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

58:011:025 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
           than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;

58:011:026 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
           treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of
           the reward.

58:011:027 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:
           for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

58:011:028 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of
           blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.

58:011:029 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which
           the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

58:011:030 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were
           compassed about seven days.

58:011:031 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed
           not, when she had received the spies with peace.

58:011:032 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell
           of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of
           David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:

58:011:033 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
           obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.

58:011:034 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
           out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight,
           turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

58:011:035 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others
           were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might
           obtain a better resurrection:

58:011:036 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea,
           moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

58:011:037 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were
           slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and
           goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;

58:011:038 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts,
           and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

58:011:039 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
           received not the promise:

58:011:040 God having provided some better thing for us, that they
           without us should not be made perfect.

58:012:001 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
           cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin
           which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience
           the race that is set before us,

58:012:002 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who
           for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
           despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
           throne of God.

58:012:003 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
           against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

58:012:004 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

58:012:005 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you
           as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of
           the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:

58:012:006 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
           son whom he receiveth.

58:012:007 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons;
           for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?

58:012:008 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,
           then are ye bastards, and not sons.

58:012:009 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
           us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in
           subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?

58:012:010 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
           pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of
           his holiness.

58:012:011 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
           grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
           fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

58:012:012 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
           knees;

58:012:013 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame
           be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.

58:012:014 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man
           shall see the Lord:

58:012:015 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest
           any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby
           many be defiled;

58:012:016 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who
           for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

58:012:017 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited
           the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of
           repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

58:012:018 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and
           that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and
           tempest,

58:012:019 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which
           voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be
           spoken to them any more:

58:012:020 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so
           much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or
           thrust through with a dart:

58:012:021 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly
           fear and quake:)

58:012:022 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the
           living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
           company of angels,

58:012:023 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are
           written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the
           spirits of just men made perfect,

58:012:024 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the
           blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of
           Abel.

58:012:025 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
           not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not
           we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:

58:012:026 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised,
           saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also
           heaven.

58:012:027 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those
           things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those
           things which cannot be shaken may remain.

58:012:028 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us
           have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence
           and godly fear:

58:012:029 For our God is a consuming fire.

58:013:001 Let brotherly love continue.

58:013:002 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
           entertained angels unawares.

58:013:003 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them
           which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.

58:013:004 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
           whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

58:013:005 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content
           with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never
           leave thee, nor forsake thee.

58:013:006 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will
           not fear what man shall do unto me.

58:013:007 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken
           unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the
           end of their conversation.

58:013:008 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

58:013:009 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it
           is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not
           with meats, which have not profited them that have been
           occupied therein.

58:013:010 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which
           serve the tabernacle.

58:013:011 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into
           the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without
           the camp.

58:013:012 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with
           his own blood, suffered without the gate.

58:013:013 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing
           his reproach.

58:013:014 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

58:013:015 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
           continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to
           his name.

58:013:016 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
           sacrifices God is well pleased.

58:013:017 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
           for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account,
           that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is
           unprofitable for you.

58:013:018 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
           things willing to live honestly.

58:013:019 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be
           restored to you the sooner.

58:013:020 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our
           Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the
           blood of the everlasting covenant,

58:013:021 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in
           you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus
           Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

58:013:022 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation:
           for I have written a letter unto you in few words.

58:013:023 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom,
           if he come shortly, I will see you.

58:013:024 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the
           saints. They of Italy salute you.

58:013:025 Grace be with you all. Amen.

Book 59        James

59:001:001 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
           twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

59:001:002 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
           temptations;

59:001:003 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

59:001:004 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
           and entire, wanting nothing.

59:001:005 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
           all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
           him.

59:001:006 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
           wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
           tossed.

59:001:007 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of
           the Lord.

59:001:008 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

59:001:009 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:

59:001:010 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of
           the grass he shall pass away.

59:001:011 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
           withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the
           grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich
           man fade away in his ways.

59:001:012 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
           tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
           promised to them that love him.

59:001:013 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for
           God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

59:001:014 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
           lust, and enticed.

59:001:015 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,
           when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

59:001:016 Do not err, my beloved brethren.

59:001:017 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
           cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
           variableness, neither shadow of turning.

59:001:018 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
           should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

59:001:019 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
           hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

59:001:020 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

59:001:021 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
           naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word,
           which is able to save your souls.

59:001:022 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
           your own selves.

59:001:023 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
           unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

59:001:024 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
           forgetteth what manner of man he was.

59:001:025 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and
           continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
           doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

59:001:026 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
           his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion
           is vain.

59:001:027 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
           To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
           keep himself unspotted from the world.

59:002:001 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
           Lord of glory, with respect of persons.

59:002:002 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring,
           in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile
           raiment;

59:002:003 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and
           say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the
           poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:

59:002:004 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges
           of evil thoughts?

59:002:005 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of
           this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he
           hath promised to them that love him?

59:002:006 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you,
           and draw you before the judgment seats?

59:002:007 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are
           called?

59:002:008 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou
           shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:

59:002:009 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are
           convinced of the law as transgressors.

59:002:010 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
           point, he is guilty of all.

59:002:011 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
           kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou
           art become a transgressor of the law.

59:002:012 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
           law of liberty.

59:002:013 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no
           mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

59:002:014 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath
           faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

59:002:015 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,

59:002:016 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed
           and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things
           which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?

59:002:017 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

59:002:018 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
           thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by
           my works.

59:002:019 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
           devils also believe, and tremble.

59:002:020 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is
           dead?

59:002:021 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
           offered Isaac his son upon the altar?

59:002:022 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was
           faith made perfect?

59:002:023 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
           God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was
           called the Friend of God.

59:002:024 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
           faith only.

59:002:025 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works,
           when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out
           another way?

59:002:026 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
           works is dead also.

59:003:001 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall
           receive the greater condemnation.

59:003:002 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in
           word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the
           whole body.

59:003:003 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey
           us; and we turn about their whole body.

59:003:004 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are
           driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very
           small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

59:003:005 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great
           things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!

59:003:006 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the
           tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and
           setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of
           hell.

59:003:007 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and
           of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of
           mankind:

59:003:008 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of
           deadly poison.

59:003:009 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
           we men, which are made after the similitude of God.

59:003:010 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
           brethren, these things ought not so to be.

59:003:011 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
           bitter?

59:003:012 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a
           vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and
           fresh.

59:003:013 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him
           shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of
           wisdom.

59:003:014 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
           not, and lie not against the truth.

59:003:015 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly,
           sensual, devilish.

59:003:016 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every
           evil work.

59:003:017 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
           peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and
           good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

59:003:018 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that
           make peace.

59:004:001 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not
           hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?

59:004:002 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot
           obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

59:004:003 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may
           consume it upon your lusts.

59:004:004 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the
           friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever
           therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

59:004:005 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
           dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

59:004:006 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth
           the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

59:004:007 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he
           will flee from you.

59:004:008 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your
           hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

59:004:009 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned
           to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

59:004:010 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift
           you up.

59:004:011 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil
           of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the
           law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art
           not a doer of the law, but a judge.

59:004:012 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who
           art thou that judgest another?

59:004:013 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into
           such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and
           get gain:

59:004:014 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is
           your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little
           time, and then vanisheth away.

59:004:015 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and
           do this, or that.

59:004:016 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is
           evil.

59:004:017 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
           him it is sin.

59:005:001 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that
           shall come upon you.

59:005:002 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

59:005:003 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall
           be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were
           fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.

59:005:004 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
           fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the
           cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of
           the Lord of sabaoth.

59:005:005 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye
           have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

59:005:006 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist
           you.

59:005:007 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
           Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the
           earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the
           early and latter rain.

59:005:008 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of
           the Lord draweth nigh.

59:005:009 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be
           condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.

59:005:010 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name
           of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of
           patience.

59:005:011 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
           patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the
           Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

59:005:012 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by
           heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but
           let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into
           condemnation.

59:005:013 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let
           him sing psalms.

59:005:014 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the
           church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in
           the name of the Lord:

59:005:015 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
           shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall
           be forgiven him.

59:005:016 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
           that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a
           righteous man availeth much.

59:005:017 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he
           prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on
           the earth by the space of three years and six months.

59:005:018 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth
           brought forth her fruit.

59:005:019 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert
           him;

59:005:020 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the
           error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide
           a multitude of sins.

Book 60        1 Peter

60:001:001 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
           throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

60:001:002 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
           through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
           sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and
           peace, be multiplied.

60:001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
           according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
           lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

60:001:004 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
           fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,

60:001:005 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
           ready to be revealed in the last time.

60:001:006 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
           be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:

60:001:007 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of
           gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
           found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of
           Jesus Christ:

60:001:008 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
           not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
           of glory:

60:001:009 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
           souls.

60:001:010 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
           diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
           you:

60:001:011 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
           which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand
           the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.

60:001:012 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto
           us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto
           you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the
           Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels
           desire to look into.

60:001:013 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope
           to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the
           revelation of Jesus Christ;

60:001:014 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to
           the former lusts in your ignorance:

60:001:015 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
           manner of conversation;

60:001:016 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

60:001:017 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
           judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your
           sojourning here in fear:

60:001:018 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
           corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
           conversation received by tradition from your fathers;

60:001:019 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
           blemish and without spot:

60:001:020 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
           world, but was manifest in these last times for you,

60:001:021 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the
           dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in
           God.

60:001:022 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
           through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see
           that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:

60:001:023 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
           incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth
           for ever.

60:001:024 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the
           flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof
           falleth away:

60:001:025 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the
           word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

60:002:001 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and
           hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,

60:002:002 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye
           may grow thereby:

60:002:003 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

60:002:004 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of
           men, but chosen of God, and precious,

60:002:005 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
           holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable
           to God by Jesus Christ.

60:002:006 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay
           in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that
           believeth on him shall not be confounded.

60:002:007 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
           which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed,
           the same is made the head of the corner,

60:002:008 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them
           which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also
           they were appointed.

60:002:009 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
           nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
           praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his
           marvellous light;

60:002:010 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people
           of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
           mercy.

60:002:011 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
           abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

60:002:012 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
           whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your
           good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of
           visitation.

60:002:013 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
           sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;

60:002:014 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
           punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do
           well.

60:002:015 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
           silence the ignorance of foolish men:

60:002:016 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of
           maliciousness, but as the servants of God.

60:002:017 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
           king.

60:002:018 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only
           to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

60:002:019 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
           endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

60:002:020 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,
           ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and
           suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with
           God.

60:002:021 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
           for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
           steps:

60:002:022 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:

60:002:023 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
           he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
           righteously:

60:002:024 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
           that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
           by whose stripes ye were healed.

60:002:025 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
           the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

60:003:001 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
           that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word
           be won by the conversation of the wives;

60:003:002 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.

60:003:003 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting
           the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;

60:003:004 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
           not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
           which is in the sight of God of great price.

60:003:005 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
           trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto
           their own husbands:

60:003:006 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters
           ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any
           amazement.

60:003:007 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
           giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as
           being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers
           be not hindered.

60:003:008 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of
           another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:

60:003:009 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but
           contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called,
           that ye should inherit a blessing.

60:003:010 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
           his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:

60:003:011 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
           ensue it.

60:003:012 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears
           are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is
           against them that do evil.

60:003:013 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
           which is good?

60:003:014 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye:
           and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;

60:003:015 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
           to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the
           hope that is in you with meekness and fear:

60:003:016 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
           you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
           your good conversation in Christ.

60:003:017 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
           well doing, than for evil doing.

60:003:018 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
           unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in
           the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

60:003:019 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

60:003:020 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering
           of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
           preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by
           water.

60:003:021 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us
           (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
           answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection
           of Jesus Christ:

60:003:022 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
           angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

60:004:001 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
           arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath
           suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;

60:004:002 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the
           flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

60:004:003 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought
           the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
           lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable
           idolatries:

60:004:004 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the
           same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:

60:004:005 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick
           and the dead.

60:004:006 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that
           are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the
           flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.

60:004:007 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
           and watch unto prayer.

60:004:008 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
           for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

60:004:009 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.

60:004:010 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
           one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

60:004:011 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any
           man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God
           giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus
           Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
           Amen.

60:004:012 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
           is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

60:004:013 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
           sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
           glad also with exceeding joy.

60:004:014 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for
           the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part
           he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

60:004:015 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as
           an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.

60:004:016 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
           but let him glorify God on this behalf.

60:004:017 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
           God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of
           them that obey not the gospel of God?

60:004:018 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the
           ungodly and the sinner appear?

60:004:019 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
           commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as
           unto a faithful Creator.

60:005:001 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,
           and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker
           of the glory that shall be revealed:

60:005:002 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
           thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
           lucre, but of a ready mind;

60:005:003 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being
           ensamples to the flock.

60:005:004 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a
           crown of glory that fadeth not away.

60:005:005 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
           all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with
           humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
           humble.

60:005:006 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
           he may exalt you in due time:

60:005:007 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

60:005:008 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
           roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

60:005:009 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same
           afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the
           world.

60:005:010 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
           glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while,
           make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.

60:005:011 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

60:005:012 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
           written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the
           true grace of God wherein ye stand.

60:005:013 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
           saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.

60:005:014 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you
           all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

Book 61        2 Peter

61:001:001 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
           that have obtained like precious faith with us through the
           righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:

61:001:002 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge
           of God, and of Jesus our Lord,

61:001:003 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
           that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
           him that hath called us to glory and virtue:

61:001:004 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
           promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
           nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world
           through lust.

61:001:005 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith
           virtue; and to virtue knowledge;

61:001:006 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and
           to patience godliness;

61:001:007 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
           charity.

61:001:008 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that
           ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of
           our Lord Jesus Christ.

61:001:009 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
           off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

61:001:010 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
           calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall
           never fall:

61:001:011 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
           into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
           Christ.

61:001:012 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
           remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be
           established in the present truth.

61:001:013 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to
           stir you up by putting you in remembrance;

61:001:014 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even
           as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.

61:001:015 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease
           to have these things always in remembrance.

61:001:016 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we
           made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
           Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.

61:001:017 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when
           there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This
           is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

61:001:018 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were
           with him in the holy mount.

61:001:019 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
           well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark
           place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your
           hearts:

61:001:020 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of
           any private interpretation.

61:001:021 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
           holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

61:002:001 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as
           there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall
           bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought
           them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.

61:002:002 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom
           the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.

61:002:003 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
           merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time
           lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.

61:002:004 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them
           down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to
           be reserved unto judgment;

61:002:005 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth
           person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood
           upon the world of the ungodly;

61:002:006 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes
           condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto
           those that after should live ungodly;

61:002:007 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of
           the wicked:

61:002:008 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and
           hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their
           unlawful deeds;)

61:002:009 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations,
           and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be
           punished:

61:002:010 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
           uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they,
           selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.

61:002:011 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring
           not railing accusation against them before the Lord.

61:002:012 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
           destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not;
           and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;

61:002:013 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that
           count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and
           blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while
           they feast with you;

61:002:014 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin;
           beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with
           covetous practices; cursed children:

61:002:015 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
           following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the
           wages of unrighteousness;

61:002:016 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with
           man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.

61:002:017 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
           tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

61:002:018 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they
           allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much
           wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live
           in error.

61:002:019 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the
           servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the
           same is he brought in bondage.

61:002:020 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
           through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
           they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end
           is worse with them than the beginning.

61:002:021 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
           righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from
           the holy commandment delivered unto them.

61:002:022 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb,
           The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was
           washed to her wallowing in the mire.

61:003:001 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both
           which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:

61:003:002 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before
           by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the
           apostles of the Lord and Saviour:

61:003:003 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
           scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

61:003:004 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
           fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
           beginning of the creation.

61:003:005 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of
           God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the
           water and in the water:

61:003:006 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
           perished:

61:003:007 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word
           are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
           judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

61:003:008 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day
           is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as
           one day.

61:003:009 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
           count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing
           that any should perish, but that all should come to
           repentance.

61:003:010 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
           the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
           the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and
           the works that are therein shall be burned up.

61:003:011 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what
           manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and
           godliness,

61:003:012 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God,
           wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the
           elements shall melt with fervent heat?

61:003:013 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new
           heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

61:003:014 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
           diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot,
           and blameless.

61:003:015 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation;
           even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom
           given unto him hath written unto you;

61:003:016 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things;
           in which are some things hard to be understood, which they
           that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the
           other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

61:003:017 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before,
           beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
           wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.

61:003:018 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
           Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever.
           Amen.

Book 62        1 John

62:001:001 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which
           we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
           hands have handled, of the Word of life;

62:001:002 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear
           witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with
           the Father, and was manifested unto us;)

62:001:003 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye
           also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is
           with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

62:001:004 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

62:001:005 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and
           declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness
           at all.

62:001:006 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in
           darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:

62:001:007 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
           fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his
           Son cleanseth us from all sin.

62:001:008 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
           truth is not in us.

62:001:009 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
           our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

62:001:010 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
           word is not in us.

62:002:001 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
           not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
           Jesus Christ the righteous:

62:002:002 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's
           only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

62:002:003 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
           commandments.

62:002:004 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
           is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

62:002:005 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
           perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.

62:002:006 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
           even as he walked.

62:002:007 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
           commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old
           commandment is the word which ye have heard from the
           beginning.

62:002:008 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true
           in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true
           light now shineth.

62:002:009 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is
           in darkness even until now.

62:002:010 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is
           none occasion of stumbling in him.

62:002:011 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
           darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that
           darkness hath blinded his eyes.

62:002:012 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are
           forgiven you for his name's sake.

62:002:013 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is
           from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye
           have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little
           children, because ye have known the Father.

62:002:014 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him
           that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young
           men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in
           you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.

62:002:015 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
           If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
           him.

62:002:016 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the
           lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father,
           but is of the world.

62:002:017 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that
           doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

62:002:018 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard
           that antichrist shall come, even now are there many
           antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.

62:002:019 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they
           had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us:
           but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they
           were not all of us.

62:002:020 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all
           things.

62:002:021 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
           because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

62:002:022 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He
           is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.

62:002:023 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he
           that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.

62:002:024 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
           beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning
           shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in
           the Father.

62:002:025 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
           life.

62:002:026 These things have I written unto you concerning them that
           seduce you.

62:002:027 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in
           you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same
           anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no
           lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.

62:002:028 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall
           appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him
           at his coming.

62:002:029 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
           doeth righteousness is born of him.

62:003:001 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
           that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world
           knoweth us not, because it knew him not.

62:003:002 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
           appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
           appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.

62:003:003 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
           even as he is pure.

62:003:004 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
           is the transgression of the law.

62:003:005 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and
           in him is no sin.

62:003:006 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath
           not seen him, neither known him.

62:003:007 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
           righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.

62:003:008 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
           from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was
           manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

62:003:009 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
           remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of
           God.

62:003:010 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of
           the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,
           neither he that loveth not his brother.

62:003:011 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that
           we should love one another.

62:003:012 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
           And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil,
           and his brother's righteous.

62:003:013 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

62:003:014 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we
           love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in
           death.

62:003:015 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that
           no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

62:003:016 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his
           life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the
           brethren.

62:003:017 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have
           need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how
           dwelleth the love of God in him?

62:003:018 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in
           tongue; but in deed and in truth.

62:003:019 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure
           our hearts before him.

62:003:020 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,
           and knoweth all things.

62:003:021 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
           toward God.

62:003:022 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
           commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his
           sight.

62:003:023 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the
           name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave
           us commandment.

62:003:024 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he
           in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the
           Spirit which he hath given us.

62:004:001 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
           they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into
           the world.

62:004:002 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
           that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:

62:004:003 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come
           in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of
           antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and
           even now already is it in the world.

62:004:004 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them:
           because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the
           world.

62:004:005 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and
           the world heareth them.

62:004:006 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not
           of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and
           the spirit of error.

62:004:007 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and
           every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

62:004:008 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

62:004:009 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
           God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might
           live through him.

62:004:010 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
           and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

62:004:011 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one
           another.

62:004:012 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
           dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

62:004:013 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
           hath given us of his Spirit.

62:004:014 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
           to be the Saviour of the world.

62:004:015 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
           dwelleth in him, and he in God.

62:004:016 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.
           God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
           God in him.

62:004:017 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in
           the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this
           world.

62:004:018 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
           because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect
           in love.

62:004:019 We love him, because he first loved us.

62:004:020 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
           liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,
           how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

62:004:021 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God
           love his brother also.

62:005:001 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:
           and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that
           is begotten of him.

62:005:002 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
           God, and keep his commandments.

62:005:003 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments:
           and his commandments are not grievous.

62:005:004 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this
           is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

62:005:005 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth
           that Jesus is the Son of God?

62:005:006 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ;
           not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the
           Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.

62:005:007 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
           the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

62:005:008 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit,
           and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

62:005:009 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is
           greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath
           testified of his Son.

62:005:010 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in
           himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar;
           because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

62:005:011 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
           life, and this life is in his Son.

62:005:012 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son
           of God hath not life.

62:005:013 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name
           of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life,
           and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

62:005:014 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we
           ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:

62:005:015 And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know
           that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

62:005:016 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death,
           he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not
           unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he
           shall pray for it.

62:005:017 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.

62:005:018 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that
           is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one
           toucheth him not.

62:005:019 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
           wickedness.

62:005:020 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
           understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are
           in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the
           true God, and eternal life.

62:005:021 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

Book 63        2 John

63:001:001 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
           the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known
           the truth;

63:001:002 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with
           us for ever.

63:001:003 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and
           from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth
           and love.

63:001:004 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in
           truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.

63:001:005 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
           commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the
           beginning, that we love one another.

63:001:006 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is
           the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye
           should walk in it.

63:001:007 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
           that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and
           an antichrist.

63:001:008 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we
           have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

63:001:009 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
           Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of
           Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.

63:001:010 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
           receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:

63:001:011 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil
           deeds.

63:001:012 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
           paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to
           face, that our joy may be full.

63:001:013 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.

Book 64        3 John

64:001:001 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the
           truth.

64:001:002 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
           be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

64:001:003 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified
           of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the
           truth.

64:001:004 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
           truth.

64:001:005 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
           brethren, and to strangers;

64:001:006 Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church:
           whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly
           sort, thou shalt do well:

64:001:007 Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking
           nothing of the Gentiles.

64:001:008 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be
           fellowhelpers to the truth.

64:001:009 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have
           the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

64:001:010 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he
           doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not
           content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the
           brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out
           of the church.

64:001:011 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is
           good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil
           hath not seen God.

64:001:012 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth
           itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our
           record is true.

64:001:013 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen
           write unto thee:

64:001:014 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face
           to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the
           friends by name.

Book 65        Jude

65:001:001 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
           them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
           Jesus Christ, and called:

65:001:002 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.

65:001:003 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
           common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and
           exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith
           which was once delivered unto the saints.

65:001:004 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before
           of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the
           grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only
           Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

65:001:005 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
           this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the
           land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.

65:001:006 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
           their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
           under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

65:001:007 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
           manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after
           strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the
           vengeance of eternal fire.

65:001:008 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
           dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

65:001:009 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
           disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him
           a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

65:001:010 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
           what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
           they corrupt themselves.

65:001:011 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
           greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in
           the gainsaying of Core.

65:001:012 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
           with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are
           without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit
           withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

65:001:013 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
           wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness
           for ever.

65:001:014 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
           saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his
           saints,

65:001:015 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
           ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have
           ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which
           ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

65:001:016 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
           lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having
           men's persons in admiration because of advantage.

65:001:017 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
           of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

65:001:018 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last
           time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

65:001:019 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
           Spirit.

65:001:020 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
           faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

65:001:021 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of
           our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

65:001:022 And of some have compassion, making a difference:

65:001:023 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire;
           hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

65:001:024 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
           present you faultless before the presence of his glory with
           exceeding joy,

65:001:025 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
           dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

Book 66        Revelation

66:001:001 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to
           shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass;
           and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant
           John:

66:001:002 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of
           Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.

66:001:003 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of
           this prophecy, and keep those things which are written
           therein: for the time is at hand.

66:001:004 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto
           you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is
           to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his
           throne;

66:001:005 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the
           first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the
           earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
           his own blood,

66:001:006 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to
           him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

66:001:007 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,
           and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth
           shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

66:001:008 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
           Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the
           Almighty.

66:001:009 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in
           tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,
           was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God,
           and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

66:001:010 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a
           great voice, as of a trumpet,

66:001:011 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,
           What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven
           churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and
           unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto
           Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

66:001:012 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
           turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;

66:001:013 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the
           Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt
           about the paps with a golden girdle.

66:001:014 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
           and his eyes were as a flame of fire;

66:001:015 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
           furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.

66:001:016 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
           went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the
           sun shineth in his strength.

66:001:017 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
           his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the
           first and the last:

66:001:018 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for
           evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

66:001:019 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which
           are, and the things which shall be hereafter;

66:001:020 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right
           hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are
           the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks
           which thou sawest are the seven churches.

66:002:001 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things
           saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who
           walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

66:002:002 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how
           thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried
           them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found
           them liars:

66:002:003 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast
           laboured, and hast not fainted.

66:002:004 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast
           left thy first love.

66:002:005 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,
           and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly,
           and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou
           repent.

66:002:006 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
           Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.

66:002:007 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
           tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

66:002:008 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things
           saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;

66:002:009 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art
           rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are
           Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

66:002:010 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the
           devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be
           tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou
           faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

66:002:011 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
           second death.

66:002:012 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
           saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

66:002:013 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's
           seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my
           faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful
           martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

66:002:014 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
           them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to
           cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat
           things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.

66:002:015 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
           Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.

66:002:016 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight
           against them with the sword of my mouth.

66:002:017 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
           hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the
           stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that
           receiveth it.

66:002:018 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These
           things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a
           flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;

66:002:019 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy
           patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the
           first.

66:002:020 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
           sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a
           prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit
           fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

66:002:021 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
           repented not.

66:002:022 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
           adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent
           of their deeds.

66:002:023 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
           shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts:
           and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

66:002:024 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
           have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of
           Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.

66:002:025 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

66:002:026 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to
           him will I give power over the nations:

66:002:027 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a
           potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of
           my Father.

66:002:028 And I will give him the morning star.

66:002:029 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches.

66:003:001 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
           saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven
           stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou
           livest, and art dead.

66:003:002 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
           ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before
           God.

66:003:003 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
           fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will
           come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I
           will come upon thee.

66:003:004 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled
           their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they
           are worthy.

66:003:005 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
           raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of
           life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before
           his angels.

66:003:006 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches.

66:003:007 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These
           things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath
           the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and
           shutteth, and no man openeth;

66:003:008 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door,
           and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and
           hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

66:003:009 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say
           they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make
           them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I
           have loved thee.

66:003:010 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will
           keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon
           all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

66:003:011 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that
           no man take thy crown.

66:003:012 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my
           God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him
           the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which
           is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God:
           and I will write upon him my new name.

66:003:013 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches.

66:003:014 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;
           These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness,
           the beginning of the creation of God;

66:003:015 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would
           thou wert cold or hot.

66:003:016 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
           will spue thee out of my mouth.

66:003:017 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
           have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,
           and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:

66:003:018 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
           mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
           clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
           and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

66:003:019 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,
           and repent.

66:003:020 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
           voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup
           with him, and he with me.

66:003:021 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my
           throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my
           Father in his throne.

66:003:022 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches.

66:004:001 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven:
           and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
           talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew
           thee things which must be hereafter.

66:004:002 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was
           set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.

66:004:003 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
           stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in
           sight like unto an emerald.

66:004:004 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and
           upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed
           in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.

66:004:005 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
           voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the
           throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

66:004:006 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto
           crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the
           throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.

66:004:007 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like
           a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the
           fourth beast was like a flying eagle.

66:004:008 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and
           they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and
           night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was,
           and is, and is to come.

66:004:009 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him
           that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,

66:004:010 The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on
           the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and
           cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

66:004:011 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and
           power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
           they are and were created.

66:005:001 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
           book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven
           seals.

66:005:002 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
           worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?

66:005:003 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,
           was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.

66:005:004 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
           to read the book, neither to look thereon.

66:005:005 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
           Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed
           to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.

66:005:006 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the
           four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as
           it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which
           are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

66:005:007 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
           that sat upon the throne.

66:005:008 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
           twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of
           them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the
           prayers of saints.

66:005:009 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
           book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
           hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
           tongue, and people, and nation;

66:005:010 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
           reign on the earth.

66:005:011 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
           the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of
           them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
           thousands;

66:005:012 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
           receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
           honour, and glory, and blessing.

66:005:013 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
           under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
           in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
           power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
           Lamb for ever and ever.

66:005:014 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
           fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

66:006:001 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard,
           as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts
           saying, Come and see.

66:006:002 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him
           had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth
           conquering, and to conquer.

66:006:003 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second
           beast say, Come and see.

66:006:004 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was
           given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth,
           and that they should kill one another: and there was given
           unto him a great sword.

66:006:005 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast
           say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he
           that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.

66:006:006 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A
           measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for
           a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

66:006:007 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of
           the fourth beast say, Come and see.

66:006:008 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat
           on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was
           given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill
           with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the
           beasts of the earth.

66:006:009 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar
           the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for
           the testimony which they held:

66:006:010 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord,
           holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on
           them that dwell on the earth?

66:006:011 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was
           said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season,
           until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that
           should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.

66:006:012 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there
           was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth
           of hair, and the moon became as blood;

66:006:013 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig
           tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
           wind.

66:006:014 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled
           together; and every mountain and island were moved out of
           their places.

66:006:015 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich
           men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
           bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in
           the rocks of the mountains;

66:006:016 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us
           from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the
           wrath of the Lamb:

66:006:017 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able
           to stand?

66:007:001 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four
           corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth,
           that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea,
           nor on any tree.

66:007:002 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the
           seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the
           four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the
           sea,

66:007:003 Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
           till we have sealed the servants of our God in their
           foreheads.

66:007:004 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there
           were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the
           tribes of the children of Israel.

66:007:005 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
           of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad
           were sealed twelve thousand.

66:007:006 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
           of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
           Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.

66:007:007 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
           tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
           Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.

66:007:008 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
           tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
           Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

66:007:009 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
           could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
           tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
           with white robes, and palms in their hands;

66:007:010 And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God
           which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.

66:007:011 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the
           elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on
           their faces, and worshipped God,

66:007:012 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and
           thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our
           God for ever and ever. Amen.

66:007:013 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these
           which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?

66:007:014 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,
           These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
           washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
           Lamb.

66:007:015 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
           and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne
           shall dwell among them.

66:007:016 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither
           shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.

66:007:017 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
           them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and
           God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

66:008:001 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
           heaven about the space of half an hour.

66:008:002 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them
           were given seven trumpets.

66:008:003 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden
           censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he
           should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden
           altar which was before the throne.

66:008:004 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of
           the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.

66:008:005 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
           altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and
           thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

66:008:006 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
           themselves to sound.

66:008:007 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire
           mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the
           third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was
           burnt up.

66:008:008 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
           burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of
           the sea became blood;

66:008:009 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and
           had life, died; and the third part of the ships were
           destroyed.

66:008:010 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from
           heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third
           part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;

66:008:011 And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third
           part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the
           waters, because they were made bitter.

66:008:012 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun
           was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third
           part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened,
           and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night
           likewise.

66:008:013 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of
           heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the
           inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the
           trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!

66:009:001 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven
           unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless
           pit.

66:009:002 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out
           of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and
           the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.

66:009:003 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and
           unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have
           power.

66:009:004 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass
           of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but
           only those men which have not the seal of God in their
           foreheads.

66:009:005 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but
           that they should be tormented five months: and their torment
           was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.

66:009:006 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it;
           and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

66:009:007 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared
           unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like
           gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.

66:009:008 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were
           as the teeth of lions.

66:009:009 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron;
           and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of
           many horses running to battle.

66:009:010 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings
           in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.

66:009:011 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the
           bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon,
           but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.

66:009:012 One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more
           hereafter.

66:009:013 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four
           horns of the golden altar which is before God,

66:009:014 Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the
           four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.

66:009:015 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an
           hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the
           third part of men.

66:009:016 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred
           thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.

66:009:017 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on
           them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and
           brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of
           lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and
           brimstone.

66:009:018 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire,
           and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of
           their mouths.

66:009:019 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for
           their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with
           them they do hurt.

66:009:020 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues
           yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should
           not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass,
           and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor
           walk:

66:009:021 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their
           sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

66:010:001 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
           with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face
           was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:

66:010:002 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his
           right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,

66:010:003 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when
           he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.

66:010:004 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was
           about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
           me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and
           write them not.

66:010:005 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the
           earth lifted up his hand to heaven,

66:010:006 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created
           heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and
           the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which
           are therein, that there should be time no longer:

66:010:007 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he
           shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished,
           as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.

66:010:008 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again,
           and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the
           hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the
           earth.

66:010:009 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the
           little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and
           it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth
           sweet as honey.

66:010:010 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it
           up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I
           had eaten it, my belly was bitter.

66:010:011 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
           peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

66:011:001 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel
           stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the
           altar, and them that worship therein.

66:011:002 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and
           measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the
           holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.

66:011:003 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall
           prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed
           in sackcloth.

66:011:004 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks
           standing before the God of the earth.

66:011:005 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
           mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt
           them, he must in this manner be killed.

66:011:006 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days
           of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to
           blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as
           they will.

66:011:007 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast
           that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war
           against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.

66:011:008 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great
           city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also
           our Lord was crucified.

66:011:009 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations
           shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall
           not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.

66:011:010 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them,
           and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because
           these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

66:011:011 And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God
           entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great
           fear fell upon them which saw them.

66:011:012 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them,
           Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and
           their enemies beheld them.

66:011:013 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
           part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men
           seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave
           glory to the God of heaven.

66:011:014 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh
           quickly.

66:011:015 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
           heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the
           kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign
           for ever and ever.

66:011:016 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
           seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,

66:011:017 Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art,
           and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy
           great power, and hast reigned.

66:011:018 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the
           time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou
           shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to
           the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and
           shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.

66:011:019 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen
           in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were
           lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake,
           and great hail.

66:012:001 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed
           with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
           crown of twelve stars:

66:012:002 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and
           pained to be delivered.

66:012:003 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a
           great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven
           crowns upon his heads.

66:012:004 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and
           did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the
           woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child
           as soon as it was born.

66:012:005 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
           with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and
           to his throne.

66:012:006 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
           prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand
           two hundred and threescore days.

66:012:007 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
           against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

66:012:008 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
           heaven.

66:012:009 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called
           the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was
           cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with
           him.

66:012:010 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
           salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the
           power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast
           down, which accused them before our God day and night.

66:012:011 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
           word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto
           the death.

66:012:012 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe
           to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil
           is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth
           that he hath but a short time.

66:012:013 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
           persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

66:012:014 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that
           she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she
           is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the
           face of the serpent.

66:012:015 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after
           the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the
           flood.

66:012:016 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her
           mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of
           his mouth.

66:012:017 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
           with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
           God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

66:013:001 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
           out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his
           horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

66:013:002 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his
           feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of
           a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and
           great authority.

66:013:003 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and
           his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after
           the beast.

66:013:004 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the
           beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto
           the beast? who is able to make war with him?

66:013:005 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
           blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty
           and two months.

66:013:006 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
           his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

66:013:007 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
           overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and
           tongues, and nations.

66:013:008 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose
           names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain
           from the foundation of the world.

66:013:009 If any man have an ear, let him hear.

66:013:010 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he
           that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.
           Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

66:013:011 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
           had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

66:013:012 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,
           and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship
           the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

66:013:013 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
           from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,

66:013:014 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of
           those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the
           beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they
           should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a
           sword, and did live.

66:013:015 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast,
           that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that
           as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be
           killed.

66:013:016 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
           and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
           foreheads:

66:013:017 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark,
           or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

66:013:018 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the
           number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his
           number is Six hundred threescore and six.

66:014:001 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and
           with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his
           Father's name written in their foreheads.

66:014:002 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,
           and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of
           harpers harping with their harps:

66:014:003 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
           before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn
           that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which
           were redeemed from the earth.

66:014:004 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
           virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he
           goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the
           firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

66:014:005 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without
           fault before the throne of God.

66:014:006 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
           everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
           earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
           people,

66:014:007 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
           the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made
           heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

66:014:008 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,
           is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink
           of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

66:014:009 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,
           If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his
           mark in his forehead, or in his hand,

66:014:010 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
           poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;
           and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
           presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

66:014:011 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:
           and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and
           his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

66:014:012 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
           the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

66:014:013 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
           are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith
           the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their
           works do follow them.

66:014:014 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
           sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden
           crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

66:014:015 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
           voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and
           reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest
           of the earth is ripe.

66:014:016 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the
           earth; and the earth was reaped.

66:014:017 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven,
           he also having a sharp sickle.

66:014:018 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power
           over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp
           sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the
           clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully
           ripe.

66:014:019 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and
           gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great
           winepress of the wrath of God.

66:014:020 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came
           out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the
           space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

66:015:001 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven
           angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up
           the wrath of God.

66:015:002 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and
           them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his
           image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name,
           stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

66:015:003 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the
           song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works,
           Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of
           saints.

66:015:004 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for
           thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship
           before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.

66:015:005 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the
           tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:

66:015:006 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven
           plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their
           breasts girded with golden girdles.

66:015:007 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
           golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and
           ever.

66:015:008 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,
           and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the
           temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were
           fulfilled.

66:016:001 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the
           seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the
           wrath of God upon the earth.

66:016:002 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;
           and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which
           had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his
           image.

66:016:003 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
           became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died
           in the sea.

66:016:004 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
           fountains of waters; and they became blood.

66:016:005 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O
           Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast
           judged thus.

66:016:006 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou
           hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.

66:016:007 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
           Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

66:016:008 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and
           power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.

66:016:009 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name
           of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented
           not to give him glory.

66:016:010 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
           beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed
           their tongues for pain,

66:016:011 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and
           their sores, and repented not of their deeds.

66:016:012 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
           Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of
           the kings of the east might be prepared.

66:016:013 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the
           mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and
           out of the mouth of the false prophet.

66:016:014 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
           forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to
           gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

66:016:015 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
           keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
           shame.

66:016:016 And he gathered them together into a place called in the
           Hebrew tongue Armageddon.

66:016:017 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
           there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the
           throne, saying, It is done.

66:016:018 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
           was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon
           the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.

66:016:019 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the
           cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in
           remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine
           of the fierceness of his wrath.

66:016:020 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

66:016:021 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every
           stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God
           because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was
           exceeding great.

66:017:001 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven
           vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will
           shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth
           upon many waters:

66:017:002 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,
           and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the
           wine of her fornication.

66:017:003 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
           saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names
           of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

66:017:004 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
           decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a
           golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of
           her fornication:

66:017:005 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
           GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

66:017:006 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
           with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I
           wondered with great admiration.

66:017:007 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I
           will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that
           carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

66:017:008 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend
           out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they
           that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not
           written in the book of life from the foundation of the world,
           when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

66:017:009 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are
           seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.

66:017:010 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and
           the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must
           continue a short space.

66:017:011 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and
           is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

66:017:012 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
           received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one
           hour with the beast.

66:017:013 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
           unto the beast.

66:017:014 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall
           overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and
           they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

66:017:015 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the
           whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and
           tongues.

66:017:016 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these
           shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked,
           and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

66:017:017 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
           agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words
           of God shall be fulfilled.

66:017:018 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
           reigneth over the kings of the earth.

66:018:001 And after these things I saw another angel come down from
           heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with
           his glory.

66:018:002 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the
           great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of
           devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every
           unclean and hateful bird.

66:018:003 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
           fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed
           fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed
           rich through the abundance of her delicacies.

66:018:004 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of
           her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that
           ye receive not of her plagues.

66:018:005 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered
           her iniquities.

66:018:006 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her
           double according to her works: in the cup which she hath
           filled fill to her double.

66:018:007 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
           much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart,
           I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.

66:018:008 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and
           mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with
           fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

66:018:009 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and
           lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for
           her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

66:018:010 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas,
           alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one
           hour is thy judgment come.

66:018:011 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her;
           for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:

66:018:012 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and
           of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet,
           and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all
           manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron,
           and marble,

66:018:013 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and
           wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and
           sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

66:018:014 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
           thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed
           from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.

66:018:015 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,
           shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and
           wailing,

66:018:016 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in
           fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and
           precious stones, and pearls!

66:018:017 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every
           shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as
           many as trade by sea, stood afar off,

66:018:018 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What
           city is like unto this great city!

66:018:019 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and
           wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made
           rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her
           costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.

66:018:020 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and
           prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

66:018:021 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
           cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that
           great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more
           at all.

66:018:022 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
           trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no
           craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more
           in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more
           at all in thee;

66:018:023 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee;
           and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be
           heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great
           men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations
           deceived.

66:018:024 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and
           of all that were slain upon the earth.

66:019:001 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in
           heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour,
           and power, unto the Lord our God:

66:019:002 For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged
           the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her
           fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her
           hand.

66:019:003 And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever
           and ever.

66:019:004 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down
           and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen;
           Alleluia.

66:019:005 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God,
           all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and
           great.

66:019:006 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as
           the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty
           thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent
           reigneth.

66:019:007 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the
           marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself
           ready.

66:019:008 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
           linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the
           righteousness of saints.

66:019:009 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
           unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me,
           These are the true sayings of God.

66:019:010 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,
           See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy
           brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for
           the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

66:019:011 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
           sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in
           righteousness he doth judge and make war.

66:019:012 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
           crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he
           himself.

66:019:013 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his
           name is called The Word of God.

66:019:014 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
           horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

66:019:015 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he
           should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of
           iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and
           wrath of Almighty God.

66:019:016 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written,
           KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

66:019:017 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a
           loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of
           heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of
           the great God;

66:019:018 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains,
           and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of
           them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and
           bond, both small and great.

66:019:019 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
           armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on
           the horse, and against his army.

66:019:020 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
           wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that
           had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped
           his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire
           burning with brimstone.

66:019:021 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon
           the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the
           fowls were filled with their flesh.

66:020:001 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of
           the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

66:020:002 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
           Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

66:020:003 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set
           a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more,
           till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he
           must be loosed a little season.

66:020:004 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
           given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were
           beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God,
           and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image,
           neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in
           their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
           years.

66:020:005 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
           years were finished. This is the first resurrection.

66:020:006 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
           resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they
           shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with
           him a thousand years.

66:020:007 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
           out of his prison,

66:020:008 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
           quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together
           to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

66:020:009 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed
           the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire
           came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

66:020:010 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of
           fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are,
           and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

66:020:011 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
           whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was
           found no place for them.

66:020:012 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
           books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the
           book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things
           which were written in the books, according to their works.

66:020:013 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
           hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were
           judged every man according to their works.

66:020:014 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is
           the second death.

66:020:015 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was
           cast into the lake of fire.

66:021:001 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
           and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more
           sea.

66:021:002 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
           God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her
           husband.

66:021:003 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
           tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,
           and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with
           them, and be their God.

66:021:004 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
           shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
           shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
           away.

66:021:005 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all
           things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are
           true and faithful.

66:021:006 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
           beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of
           the fountain of the water of life freely.

66:021:007 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
           God, and he shall be my son.

66:021:008 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
           murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and
           all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth
           with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

66:021:009 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
           seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with
           me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the
           Lamb's wife.

66:021:010 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
           mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
           descending out of heaven from God,

66:021:011 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone
           most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

66:021:012 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at
           the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are
           the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:

66:021:013 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the
           south three gates; and on the west three gates.

66:021:014 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them
           the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

66:021:015 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
           city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.

66:021:016 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as
           the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve
           thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height
           of it are equal.

66:021:017 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and
           four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of
           the angel.

66:021:018 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
           was pure gold, like unto clear glass.

66:021:019 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished
           with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was
           jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the
           fourth, an emerald;

66:021:020 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
           chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth,
           a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an
           amethyst.

66:021:021 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate
           was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as
           it were transparent glass.

66:021:022 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
           Lamb are the temple of it.

66:021:023 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
           shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb
           is the light thereof.

66:021:024 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the
           light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory
           and honour into it.

66:021:025 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
           shall be no night there.

66:021:026 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
           it.

66:021:027 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
           defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a
           lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

66:022:001 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
           crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

66:022:002 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
           river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of
           fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of
           the tree were for the healing of the nations.

66:022:003 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of
           the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

66:022:004 And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their
           foreheads.

66:022:005 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,
           neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light:
           and they shall reign for ever and ever.

66:022:006 And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and
           the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto
           his servants the things which must shortly be done.

66:022:007 Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
           of the prophecy of this book.

66:022:008 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had
           heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the
           angel which shewed me these things.

66:022:009 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
           fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them
           which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.

66:022:010 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
           this book: for the time is at hand.

66:022:011 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
           filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let
           him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy
           still.

66:022:012 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give
           every man according as his work shall be.

66:022:013 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and
           the last.

66:022:014 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
           right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates
           into the city.

66:022:015 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
           murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a
           lie.

66:022:016 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things
           in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and
           the bright and morning star.

66:022:017 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that
           heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
           whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.

66:022:018 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
           prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things,
           God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this
           book:

66:022:019 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of
           this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of
           life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are
           written in this book.

66:022:020 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
           Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

66:022:021 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
