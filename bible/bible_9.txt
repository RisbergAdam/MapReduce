19:083:006 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
           Hagarenes;

19:083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
           inhabitants of Tyre;

19:083:008 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children
           of Lot. Selah.

19:083:009 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to
           Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

19:083:010 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

19:083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
           princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

19:083:012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
           possession.

19:083:013 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
           wind.

19:083:014 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
           mountains on fire;

19:083:015 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
           thy storm.

19:083:016 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
           LORD.

19:083:017 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
           put to shame, and perish:

19:083:018 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
           the most high over all the earth.

19:084:001 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

19:084:002 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
           LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

19:084:003 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest
           for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O
           LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

19:084:004 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
           praising thee. Selah.

19:084:005 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart
           are the ways of them.

19:084:006 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the
           rain also filleth the pools.

19:084:007 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
           appeareth before God.

19:084:008 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
           Selah.

19:084:009 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
           anointed.

19:084:010 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had
           rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell
           in the tents of wickedness.

19:084:011 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
           and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
           uprightly.

19:084:012 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

19:085:001 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast
           brought back the captivity of Jacob.

19:085:002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast
           covered all their sin. Selah.

19:085:003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself
           from the fierceness of thine anger.

19:085:004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward
           us to cease.

19:085:005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
           anger to all generations?

19:085:006 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
           thee?

19:085:007 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

19:085:008 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak
           peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not
           turn again to folly.

19:085:009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory
           may dwell in our land.

19:085:010 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
           kissed each other.

19:085:011 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
           look down from heaven.

19:085:012 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land
           shall yield her increase.

19:085:013 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
           of his steps.

19:086:001 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

19:086:002 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy
           servant that trusteth in thee.

19:086:003 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

19:086:004 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
           lift up my soul.

19:086:005 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous
           in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

19:086:006 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of
           my supplications.

19:086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
           answer me.

19:086:008 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither
           are there any works like unto thy works.

19:086:009 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
           thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

19:086:010 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
           alone.

19:086:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
           heart to fear thy name.

19:086:012 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I
           will glorify thy name for evermore.

19:086:013 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
           soul from the lowest hell.

19:086:014 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
           violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee
           before them.

19:086:015 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
           longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

19:086:016 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
           thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

19:086:017 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
           and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and
           comforted me.

19:087:001 His foundation is in the holy mountains.

19:087:002 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings
           of Jacob.

19:087:003 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

19:087:004 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
           behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born
           there.

19:087:005 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in
           her: and the highest himself shall establish her.

19:087:006 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
           man was born there. Selah.

19:087:007 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be
           there: all my springs are in thee.

19:088:001 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
           thee:

19:088:002 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

19:088:003 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
           the grave.

19:088:004 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a
           man that hath no strength:

19:088:005 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
           whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy
           hand.

19:088:006 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the
           deeps.

19:088:007 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with
           all thy waves. Selah.

19:088:008 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast
           made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot
           come forth.

19:088:009 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
           daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

19:088:010 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
           praise thee? Selah.

19:088:011 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
           faithfulness in destruction?

19:088:012 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness
           in the land of forgetfulness?

19:088:013 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall
           my prayer prevent thee.

19:088:014 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
           from me?

19:088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I
           suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

19:088:016 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

19:088:017 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
           about together.

19:088:018 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
           acquaintance into darkness.

19:089:001 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
           will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

19:089:002 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
           faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

19:089:003 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David
           my servant,

19:089:004 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
           all generations. Selah.

19:089:005 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
           faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

19:089:006 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
           the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

19:089:007 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and
           to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

19:089:008 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or
           to thy faithfulness round about thee?

19:089:009 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof
           arise, thou stillest them.

19:089:010 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
           hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

19:089:011 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the
           world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

19:089:012 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and
           Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.

19:089:013 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
           right hand.

19:089:014 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy
           and truth shall go before thy face.

19:089:015 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
           walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

19:089:016 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
           righteousness shall they be exalted.

19:089:017 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour
           our horn shall be exalted.

19:089:018 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
           king.

19:089:019 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I
           have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one
           chosen out of the people.

19:089:020 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I
           anointed him:

19:089:021 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
           strengthen him.

19:089:022 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
           afflict him.

19:089:023 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
           that hate him.

19:089:024 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
           name shall his horn be exalted.

19:089:025 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
           rivers.

19:089:026 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
           of my salvation.

19:089:027 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of
           the earth.

19:089:028 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
           shall stand fast with him.

19:089:029 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne
           as the days of heaven.

19:089:030 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

19:089:031 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

19:089:032 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
           iniquity with stripes.

19:089:033 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
           him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

19:089:034 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
           out of my lips.

19:089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto
           David.

19:089:036 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun
           before me.

19:089:037 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a
           faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

19:089:038 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
           thine anointed.

19:089:039 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
           profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

19:089:040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
           strong holds to ruin.

19:089:041 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
           neighbours.

19:089:042 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
           made all his enemies to rejoice.

19:089:043 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
           him to stand in the battle.

19:089:044 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
           the ground.

19:089:045 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered
           him with shame. Selah.

19:089:046 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy
           wrath burn like fire?

19:089:047 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all
           men in vain?

19:089:048 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
           deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

19:089:049 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou
           swarest unto David in thy truth?

19:089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
           my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

19:089:051 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith
           they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

19:089:052 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

19:090:001 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

19:090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
           formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
           everlasting, thou art God.

19:090:003 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye
           children of men.

19:090:004 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it
           is past, and as a watch in the night.

19:090:005 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
           in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.

19:090:006 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening
           it is cut down, and withereth.

19:090:007 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
           troubled.

19:090:008 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
           the light of thy countenance.

19:090:009 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our
           years as a tale that is told.

19:090:010 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
           reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their
           strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly
           away.

19:090:011 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
           fear, so is thy wrath.

19:090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
           unto wisdom.

19:090:013 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning
           thy servants.

19:090:014 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
           glad all our days.

19:090:015 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
           us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

19:090:016 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto
           their children.

19:090:017 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and
           establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of
           our hands establish thou it.

19:091:001 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall
           abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

19:091:002 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
           God; in him will I trust.

19:091:003 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
           from the noisome pestilence.

19:091:004 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
           shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

19:091:005 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
           arrow that flieth by day;

19:091:006 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
           destruction that wasteth at noonday.

19:091:007 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
           right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

19:091:008 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of
           the wicked.

19:091:009 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
           most High, thy habitation;

19:091:010 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
           nigh thy dwelling.

19:091:011 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
           all thy ways.

19:091:012 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
           foot against a stone.

19:091:013 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and
           the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

19:091:014 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
           him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

19:091:015 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with
           him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

19:091:016 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

19:092:001 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING
           PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:

19:092:002 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
           faithfulness every night,

19:092:003 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
           the harp with a solemn sound.

19:092:004 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
           triumph in the works of thy hands.

19:092:005 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very
           deep.

19:092:006 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand
           this.

19:092:007 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers
           of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed
           for ever:

19:092:008 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

19:092:009 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
           perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

19:092:010 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
           shall be anointed with fresh oil.

19:092:011 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine
           ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against
           me.

19:092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
           like a cedar in Lebanon.

19:092:013 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish
           in the courts of our God.

19:092:014 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be
           fat and flourishing;

19:092:015 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is
           no unrighteousness in him.

19:093:001 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
           clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the
           world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

19:093:002 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

19:093:003 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
           their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

19:093:004 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,
           yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.

19:093:005 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house,
           O LORD, for ever.

19:094:001 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom
           vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.

19:094:002 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to
           the proud.

19:094:003 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
           triumph?

19:094:004 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
           workers of iniquity boast themselves?

19:094:005 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
           heritage.

19:094:006 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the
           fatherless.

19:094:007 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
           Jacob regard it.

19:094:008 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
           will ye be wise?

19:094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
           eye, shall he not see?

19:094:010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
           teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

19:094:011 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

19:094:012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
           him out of thy law;

19:094:013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
           until the pit be digged for the wicked.

19:094:014 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
           forsake his inheritance.

19:094:015 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
           upright in heart shall follow it.

19:094:016 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will
           stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

19:094:017 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
           silence.

19:094:018 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

19:094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
           my soul.

19:094:020 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
           frameth mischief by a law?

19:094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
           righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

19:094:022 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my
           refuge.

19:094:023 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
           them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall
           cut them off.

19:095:001 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise
           to the rock of our salvation.

19:095:002 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
           joyful noise unto him with psalms.

19:095:003 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

19:095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of
           the hills is his also.

19:095:005 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
           land.

19:095:006 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the
           LORD our maker.

19:095:007 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and
           the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

19:095:008 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the
           day of temptation in the wilderness:

19:095:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

19:095:010 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
           It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not
           known my ways:

19:095:011 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into
           my rest.

19:096:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the
           earth.

19:096:002 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation
           from day to day.

19:096:003 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
           people.

19:096:004 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be
           feared above all gods.

19:096:005 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made
           the heavens.

19:096:006 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in
           his sanctuary.

19:096:007 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
           LORD glory and strength.

19:096:008 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
           offering, and come into his courts.

19:096:009 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
           all the earth.

19:096:010 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
           shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall
           judge the people righteously.

19:096:011 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the
           sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

19:096:012 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall
           all the trees of the wood rejoice

19:096:013 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
           earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the
           people with his truth.

19:097:001 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
           isles be glad thereof.

19:097:002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
           judgment are the habitation of his throne.

19:097:003 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round
           about.

19:097:004 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
           trembled.

19:097:005 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
           presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

19:097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see
           his glory.

19:097:007 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
           themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.

19:097:008 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
           because of thy judgments, O LORD.

19:097:009 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
           far above all gods.

19:097:010 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of
           his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

19:097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright
           in heart.

19:097:012 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
           remembrance of his holiness.

19:098:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
           things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the
           victory.

19:098:002 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath
           he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

19:098:003 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
           Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of
           our God.

19:098:004 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
           noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

19:098:005 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice
           of a psalm.

19:098:006 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before
           the LORD, the King.

19:098:007 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
           that dwell therein.

19:098:008 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful
           together

19:098:009 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
           righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with
           equity.

19:099:001 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between
           the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

19:099:002 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the
           people.

19:099:003 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

19:099:004 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
           equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

19:099:005 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for
           he is holy.

19:099:006 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
           call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered
           them.

19:099:007 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
           testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

19:099:008 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
           forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their
           inventions.

19:099:009 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
           LORD our God is holy.

19:100:001 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

19:100:002 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
           singing.

19:100:003 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us,
           and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his
           pasture.

19:100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts
           with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

19:100:005 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
           endureth to all generations.

19:101:001 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
           sing.

19:101:002 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
           come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect
           heart.

19:101:003 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work
           of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

19:101:004 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
           person.

19:101:005 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off:
           him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I
           suffer.

19:101:006 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they
           may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall
           serve me.

19:101:007 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he
           that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

19:101:008 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may
           cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

19:102:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

19:102:002 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
           incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me
           speedily.

19:102:003 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned
           as an hearth.

19:102:004 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
           to eat my bread.

19:102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
           skin.

19:102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
           desert.

19:102:007 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

19:102:008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
           against me are sworn against me.

19:102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
           weeping.

19:102:010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
           lifted me up, and cast me down.

19:102:011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
           like grass.

19:102:012 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
           unto all generations.

19:102:013 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
           favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

19:102:014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
           dust thereof.

19:102:015 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
           kings of the earth thy glory.

19:102:016 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
           glory.

19:102:017 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
           their prayer.

19:102:018 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
           people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

19:102:019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
           heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

19:102:020 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
           appointed to death;

19:102:021 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
           Jerusalem;

19:102:022 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
           serve the LORD.

19:102:023 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

19:102:024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
           thy years are throughout all generations.

19:102:025 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
           heavens are the work of thy hands.

19:102:026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
           shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
           them, and they shall be changed:

19:102:027 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

19:102:028 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
           shall be established before thee.

19:103:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless
           his holy name.

19:103:002 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

19:103:003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
           diseases;

19:103:004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee
           with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

19:103:005 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth
           is renewed like the eagle's.

19:103:006 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
           oppressed.

19:103:007 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children
           of Israel.

19:103:008 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
           plenteous in mercy.

19:103:009 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
           ever.

19:103:010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
           according to our iniquities.

19:103:011 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
           mercy toward them that fear him.

19:103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed
           our transgressions from us.

19:103:013 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth
           them that fear him.

19:103:014 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

19:103:015 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field,
           so he flourisheth.

19:103:016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
           thereof shall know it no more.

19:103:017 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
           upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
           children;

19:103:018 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
           commandments to do them.

19:103:019 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
           kingdom ruleth over all.

19:103:020 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
           his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

19:103:021 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
           do his pleasure.

19:103:022 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
           bless the LORD, O my soul.

19:104:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
           thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

19:104:002 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
           stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

19:104:003 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
           the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the
           wind:

19:104:004 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

19:104:005 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
           removed for ever.

19:104:006 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
           stood above the mountains.

19:104:007 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they
           hasted away.

19:104:008 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
           the place which thou hast founded for them.

19:104:009 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
           turn not again to cover the earth.

19:104:010 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
           hills.

19:104:011 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
           quench their thirst.

19:104:012 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
           which sing among the branches.

19:104:013 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is
           satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

19:104:014 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
           service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

19:104:015 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make
           his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

19:104:016 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
           which he hath planted;

19:104:017 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
           trees are her house.

19:104:018 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
           for the conies.

19:104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
           down.

19:104:020 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
           of the forest do creep forth.

19:104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat
           from God.

19:104:022 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
           down in their dens.

19:104:023 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
           evening.

19:104:024 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
           them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

19:104:025 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
           innumerable, both small and great beasts.

19:104:026 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
           made to play therein.

19:104:027 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their
           meat in due season.

19:104:028 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
           they are filled with good.

19:104:029 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away
           their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

19:104:030 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
           renewest the face of the earth.

19:104:031 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
           rejoice in his works.

19:104:032 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
           hills, and they smoke.

19:104:033 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing
           praise to my God while I have my being.

19:104:034 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
           LORD.

19:104:035 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
           wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye
           the LORD.

19:105:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known
           his deeds among the people.

19:105:002 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his
           wondrous works.

19:105:003 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
           seek the LORD.

19:105:004 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

19:105:005 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
           and the judgments of his mouth;

19:105:006 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
           chosen.

19:105:007 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

19:105:008 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
           commanded to a thousand generations.

19:105:009 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

19:105:010 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
           an everlasting covenant:

19:105:011 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
           your inheritance:

19:105:012 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
           strangers in it.

19:105:013 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
           another people;

19:105:014 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
           for their sakes;

19:105:015 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

19:105:016 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
           whole staff of bread.

19:105:017 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
           servant:

19:105:018 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

19:105:019 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
           him.

19:105:020 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people,
           and let him go free.

19:105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

19:105:022 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
           wisdom.

19:105:023 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
           of Ham.

19:105:024 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
           than their enemies.

19:105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly
           with his servants.

19:105:026 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

19:105:027 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
           Ham.

19:105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
           against his word.

19:105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

19:105:030 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
           of their kings.

19:105:031 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in
           all their coasts.

19:105:032 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

19:105:033 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
           trees of their coasts.

19:105:034 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
           without number,

19:105:035 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
           fruit of their ground.

19:105:036 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of
           all their strength.

19:105:037 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
           not one feeble person among their tribes.

19:105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
           upon them.

19:105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in
           the night.

19:105:040 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
           with the bread of heaven.

19:105:041 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
           dry places like a river.

19:105:042 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

19:105:043 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
           gladness:

19:105:044 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
           labour of the people;

19:105:045 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.
           Praise ye the LORD.

19:106:001 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is
           good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

19:106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
           all his praise?

19:106:003 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
           righteousness at all times.

19:106:004 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto
           thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

19:106:005 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in
           the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine
           inheritance.

19:106:006 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
           we have done wickedly.

19:106:007 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
           remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him
           at the sea, even at the Red sea.

19:106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
           make his mighty power to be known.

19:106:009 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
           them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

19:106:010 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
           redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

19:106:011 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of
           them left.

19:106:012 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

19:106:013 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

19:106:014 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
           the desert.

19:106:015 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
           soul.

19:106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
           LORD.

19:106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
           company of Abiram.

19:106:018 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
           the wicked.

19:106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

19:106:020 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
           that eateth grass.

19:106:021 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
           Egypt;

19:106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
           Red sea.

19:106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
           his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his
           wrath, lest he should destroy them.

19:106:024 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
           word:

19:106:025 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
           of the LORD.

19:106:026 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
           them in the wilderness:

19:106:027 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
           them in the lands.

19:106:028 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
           sacrifices of the dead.

19:106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
           plague brake in upon them.

19:106:030 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
           plague was stayed.

19:106:031 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
           generations for evermore.

19:106:032 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
           ill with Moses for their sakes:

19:106:033 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
           with his lips.

19:106:034 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
           commanded them:

19:106:035 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

19:106:036 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

19:106:037 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
           devils,

19:106:038 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
           their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of
           Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

19:106:039 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a
           whoring with their own inventions.

19:106:040 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his
           people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

19:106:041 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
           hated them ruled over them.

19:106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
           subjection under their hand.

19:106:043 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
           their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

19:106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
           cry:

19:106:045 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented
           according to the multitude of his mercies.

19:106:046 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
           captives.

19:106:047 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
           to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy
           praise.

19:106:048 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
           everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the
           LORD.

19:107:001 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:107:002 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed
           from the hand of the enemy;

19:107:003 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
           the west, from the north, and from the south.

19:107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found
           no city to dwell in.

19:107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

19:107:006 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he
           delivered them out of their distresses.

19:107:007 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to
           a city of habitation.

19:107:008 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:009 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry
           soul with goodness.

19:107:010 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being
           bound in affliction and iron;

19:107:011 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
           the counsel of the most High:

19:107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
           down, and there was none to help.

19:107:013 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
           them out of their distresses.

19:107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
           brake their bands in sunder.

19:107:015 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:016 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
           iron in sunder.

19:107:017 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
           iniquities, are afflicted.

19:107:018 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
           unto the gates of death.

19:107:019 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
           them out of their distresses.

19:107:020 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
           their destructions.

19:107:021 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:022 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
           declare his works with rejoicing.

19:107:023 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
           great waters;

19:107:024 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

19:107:025 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
           up the waves thereof.

19:107:026 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
           their soul is melted because of trouble.

19:107:027 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
           at their wit's end.

19:107:028 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
           them out of their distresses.

19:107:029 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
           still.

19:107:030 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
           unto their desired haven.

19:107:031 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:032 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
           praise him in the assembly of the elders.

19:107:033 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
           dry ground;

19:107:034 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
           that dwell therein.

19:107:035 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
           ground into watersprings.

19:107:036 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
           a city for habitation;

19:107:037 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
           fruits of increase.

19:107:038 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
           and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

19:107:039 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
           affliction, and sorrow.

19:107:040 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
           in the wilderness, where there is no way.

19:107:041 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
           him families like a flock.

19:107:042 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity
           shall stop her mouth.

19:107:043 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
           understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

19:108:001 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even
           with my glory.

19:108:002 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

19:108:003 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
           praises unto thee among the nations.

19:108:004 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth
           reacheth unto the clouds.

19:108:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
           all the earth;

19:108:006 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand,
           and answer me.

19:108:007 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
           Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

19:108:008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
           of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

19:108:009 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
           Philistia will I triumph.

19:108:010 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
           Edom?

19:108:011 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
           O God, go forth with our hosts?

19:108:012 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

19:108:013 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
           tread down our enemies.

19:109:001 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

19:109:002 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
           opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying
           tongue.

19:109:003 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
           against me without a cause.

19:109:004 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
           prayer.

19:109:005 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my
           love.

19:109:006 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his
           right hand.

19:109:007 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
           prayer become sin.

19:109:008 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

19:109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

19:109:010 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
           seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

19:109:011 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
           strangers spoil his labour.

19:109:012 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
           be any to favour his fatherless children.

19:109:013 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
           let their name be blotted out.

19:109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
           and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

19:109:015 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
           the memory of them from the earth.

19:109:016 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
           the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in
           heart.

19:109:017 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
           not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

19:109:018 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
           so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into
           his bones.

19:109:019 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for
           a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

19:109:020 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
           of them that speak evil against my soul.

19:109:021 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
           because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

19:109:022 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

19:109:023 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up
           and down as the locust.

19:109:024 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
           fatness.

19:109:025 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
           they shaked their heads.

19:109:026 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

19:109:027 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD,
           hast done it.

19:109:028 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
           ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

19:109:029 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
           themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

19:109:030 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
           praise him among the multitude.

19:109:031 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
           from those that condemn his soul.

19:110:001 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
           make thine enemies thy footstool.

19:110:002 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
           thou in the midst of thine enemies.

19:110:003 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
           beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast
           the dew of thy youth.

19:110:004 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
           for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

19:110:005 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the
           day of his wrath.

19:110:006 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places
           with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many
           countries.

19:110:007 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he
           lift up the head.

19:111:001 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole
           heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the
           congregation.

19:111:002 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
           have pleasure therein.

19:111:003 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
           endureth for ever.

19:111:004 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
           gracious and full of compassion.

19:111:005 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
           mindful of his covenant.

19:111:006 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
           give them the heritage of the heathen.

19:111:007 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
           commandments are sure.

19:111:008 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
           uprightness.

19:111:009 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
           covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

19:111:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
           understanding have all they that do his commandments: his
           praise endureth for ever.

19:112:001 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
           that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

19:112:002 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
           upright shall be blessed.

19:112:003 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
           endureth for ever.

19:112:004 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
           gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

19:112:005 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
           affairs with discretion.

19:112:006 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be
           in everlasting remembrance.

19:112:007 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
           trusting in the LORD.

19:112:008 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
           his desire upon his enemies.

19:112:009 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his
           righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted
           with honour.

19:112:010 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
           his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall
           perish.

19:113:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
           the name of the LORD.

19:113:002 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
           evermore.

19:113:003 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
           LORD's name is to be praised.

19:113:004 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
           heavens.

19:113:005 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

19:113:006 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
           and in the earth!

19:113:007 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
           out of the dunghill;

19:113:008 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
           people.

19:113:009 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
           mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.

19:114:001 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
           people of strange language;

19:114:002 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

19:114:003 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

19:114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
           lambs.

19:114:005 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
           that thou wast driven back?

19:114:006 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
           like lambs?

19:114:007 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
           presence of the God of Jacob;

19:114:008 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
           fountain of waters.

19:115:001 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give
           glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

19:115:002 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

19:115:003 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
           pleased.

19:115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

19:115:005 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
           see not:

19:115:006 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
           smell not:

19:115:007 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
           walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

19:115:008 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
           trusteth in them.

19:115:009 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
           shield.

19:115:010 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
           their shield.

19:115:011 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
           their shield.

19:115:012 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
           bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

19:115:013 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

19:115:014 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
           children.

19:115:015 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

19:115:016 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth
           hath he given to the children of men.

19:115:017 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
           silence.

19:115:018 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
           evermore. Praise the LORD.

19:116:001 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
           supplications.

19:116:002 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I
           call upon him as long as I live.

19:116:003 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
           hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

19:116:004 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech
           thee, deliver my soul.

19:116:005 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

19:116:006 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he
           helped me.

19:116:007 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
           bountifully with thee.

19:116:008 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
           tears, and my feet from falling.

19:116:009 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

19:116:010 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

19:116:011 I said in my haste, All men are liars.

19:116:012 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
           me?

19:116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of
           the LORD.

19:116:014 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
           his people.

19:116:015 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

19:116:016 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
           of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

19:116:017 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
           call upon the name of the LORD.

19:116:018 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
           his people.

19:116:019 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
           Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

19:117:001 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.

19:117:002 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
           the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.

19:118:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:118:002 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

19:118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
           ever.

19:118:004 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:118:005 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
           set me in a large place.

19:118:006 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
           me?

19:118:007 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore
           shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.

19:118:008 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
           man.

19:118:009 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
           princes.

19:118:010 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
           will I destroy them.

19:118:011 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
           the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

19:118:012 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
           fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy
           them.

19:118:013 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
           helped me.

19:118:014 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

19:118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
           the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

19:118:016 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
           LORD doeth valiantly.

19:118:017 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

19:118:018 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
           unto death.

19:118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them,
           and I will praise the LORD:

19:118:020 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

19:118:021 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
           salvation.

19:118:022 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
           of the corner.

19:118:023 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

19:118:024 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
           be glad in it.

19:118:025 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
           now prosperity.

19:118:026 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
           blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

19:118:027 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the
           sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

19:118:028 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
           will exalt thee.

19:118:029 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:119:001 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of
           the LORD.

19:119:002 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
           with the whole heart.

19:119:003 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

19:119:004 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.

19:119:005 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

19:119:006 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
           commandments.

19:119:007 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall
           have learned thy righteous judgments.

19:119:008 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.

19:119:009 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
           thereto according to thy word.

19:119:010 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
           from thy commandments.

19:119:011 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
           against thee.

19:119:012 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.

19:119:013 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

19:119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
           all riches.

19:119:015 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
           ways.

19:119:016 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
           word.

19:119:017 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
           thy word.

19:119:018 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
           thy law.

19:119:019 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
           me.

19:119:020 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
           judgments at all times.

19:119:021 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
           thy commandments.

19:119:022 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
           testimonies.

19:119:023 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
           meditate in thy statutes.

19:119:024 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.

19:119:025 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
           thy word.

19:119:026 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
           statutes.

19:119:027 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
           of thy wondrous works.

19:119:028 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
           unto thy word.

19:119:029 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
           graciously.

19:119:030 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
           before me.

19:119:031 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to
           shame.

19:119:032 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt
           enlarge my heart.

19:119:033 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
           unto the end.

19:119:034 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
           observe it with my whole heart.

19:119:035 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do
           I delight.

19:119:036 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
           covetousness.

19:119:037 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
           in thy way.

19:119:038 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy
           fear.

19:119:039 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are
           good.

19:119:040 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
           righteousness.

19:119:041 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
           according to thy word.

19:119:042 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
           for I trust in thy word.

19:119:043 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
           have hoped in thy judgments.

19:119:044 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

19:119:045 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

19:119:046 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will
           not be ashamed.

19:119:047 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
           loved.

19:119:048 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
           have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

19:119:049 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast
           caused me to hope.

19:119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
           quickened me.

19:119:051 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
           declined from thy law.

19:119:052 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
           myself.

19:119:053 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
           forsake thy law.

19:119:054 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.

19:119:055 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have
           kept thy law.

19:119:056 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

19:119:057 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
           words.

19:119:058 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto
           me according to thy word.

19:119:059 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

19:119:060 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

19:119:061 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
           forgotten thy law.

19:119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of
           thy righteous judgments.

19:119:063 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
           keep thy precepts.

19:119:064 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy
           statutes.

19:119:065 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
           thy word.

19:119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
           commandments.

19:119:067 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
           word.

19:119:068 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

19:119:069 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
           precepts with my whole heart.

19:119:070 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.

19:119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
           learn thy statutes.

19:119:072 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
           and silver.

19:119:073 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me
           understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

19:119:074 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
           have hoped in thy word.

19:119:075 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
           faithfulness hast afflicted me.

19:119:076 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
           according to thy word unto thy servant.

19:119:077 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
           law is my delight.

19:119:078 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
           without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.

19:119:079 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
           known thy testimonies.

19:119:080 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

19:119:081 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.

19:119:082 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort
           me?

19:119:083 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not
           forget thy statutes.

19:119:084 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
           judgment on them that persecute me?

19:119:085 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy
           law.

19:119:086 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
           wrongfully; help thou me.

19:119:087 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
           precepts.

19:119:088 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
           testimony of thy mouth.

19:119:089 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

19:119:090 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast
           established the earth, and it abideth.

19:119:091 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
           are thy servants.

19:119:092 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
           perished in mine affliction.

19:119:093 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
           quickened me.

19:119:094 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.

19:119:095 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
           consider thy testimonies.

19:119:096 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
           exceeding broad.

19:119:097 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.

19:119:098 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
           enemies: for they are ever with me.

19:119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
           testimonies are my meditation.

19:119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
           precepts.

19:119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
           keep thy word.

19:119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
           me.

19:119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
           to my mouth!

19:119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
           every false way.

19:119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

19:119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
           righteous judgments.

19:119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
           thy word.

19:119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
           LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

19:119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
           law.

19:119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
           precepts.

19:119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
           are the rejoicing of my heart.

19:119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
           unto the end.

19:119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.

19:119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.

19:119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
           of my God.

19:119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
           not be ashamed of my hope.

19:119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
           unto thy statutes continually.

19:119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
           for their deceit is falsehood.

19:119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
           therefore I love thy testimonies.

19:119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
           judgments.

19:119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
           oppressors.

19:119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
           me.

19:119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
           righteousness.

19:119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
           thy statutes.

19:119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
           testimonies.

19:119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
           thy law.

19:119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
           gold.

19:119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
           be right; and I hate every false way.

19:119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
           them.

19:119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
           understanding unto the simple.

19:119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
           commandments.

19:119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
           do unto those that love thy name.

19:119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
           dominion over me.

19:119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
           precepts.

19:119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
           statutes.

19:119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
           law.

19:119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.

19:119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
           very faithful.

19:119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
           thy words.

19:119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.

19:119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.

19:119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
           is the truth.

19:119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
           commandments are my delights.

19:119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
           understanding, and I shall live.

19:119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
           statutes.

19:119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

19:119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
           thy word.

19:119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
           thy word.

19:119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
           quicken me according to thy judgment.

19:119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
           thy law.

19:119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.

19:119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
           founded them for ever.

19:119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
           thy law.

19:119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
           word.

19:119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
           statutes.

19:119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
           thy judgments.

19:119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
           from thy testimonies.

19:119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
           not thy word.

19:119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
           according to thy lovingkindness.

19:119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
           righteous judgments endureth for ever.

19:119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
           standeth in awe of thy word.

19:119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.

19:119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.

19:119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
           judgments.

19:119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
           offend them.

19:119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
           commandments.

19:119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
           exceedingly.

19:119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
           are before thee.

19:119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
           understanding according to thy word.

19:119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
           thy word.

19:119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
           statutes.

19:119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
           are righteousness.

19:119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.

19:119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
           delight.

19:119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
           judgments help me.

19:119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
           do not forget thy commandments.

19:120:001 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.

19:120:002 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
           tongue.

19:120:003 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto
           thee, thou false tongue?

19:120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

19:120:005 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
           of Kedar!

19:120:006 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.

19:120:007 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.

19:121:001 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
           help.

19:121:002 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

19:121:003 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
           will not slumber.

19:121:004 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor
           sleep.

19:121:005 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
           hand.

19:121:006 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

19:121:007 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
           thy soul.

19:121:008 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
           this time forth, and even for evermore.

19:122:001 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
           the LORD.

19:122:002 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

19:122:003 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

19:122:004 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
           testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

19:122:005 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the
           house of David.

19:122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
           thee.

19:122:007 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

19:122:008 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace
           be within thee.

19:122:009 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.

19:123:001 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
           heavens.

19:123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
           masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
           mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that
           he have mercy upon us.

19:123:003 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
           exceedingly filled with contempt.

19:123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
           are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

19:124:001 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may
           Israel say;

19:124:002 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
           up against us:

19:124:003 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
           kindled against us:

19:124:004 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over
           our soul:

19:124:005 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

19:124:006 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
           teeth.

19:124:007 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
           the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

19:124:008 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and
           earth.

19:125:001 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which
           cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.

19:125:002 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is
           round about his people from henceforth even for ever.

19:125:003 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
           righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto
           iniquity.

19:125:004 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
           upright in their hearts.

19:125:005 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
           shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace
           shall be upon Israel.

19:126:001 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
           them that dream.

19:126:002 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
           singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done
           great things for them.

19:126:003 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

19:126:004 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

19:126:005 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

19:126:006 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
           doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
           him.

19:127:001 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that
           build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh
           but in vain.

19:127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat
           the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

19:127:003 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
           womb is his reward.

19:127:004 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
           the youth.

19:127:005 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
           not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the
           gate.

19:128:001 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in
           his ways.

19:128:002 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
           be, and it shall be well with thee.

19:128:003 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
           house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

19:128:004 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
           LORD.

19:128:005 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
           good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

19:128:006 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
           Israel.

19:129:001 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel
           now say:

19:129:002 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they
           have not prevailed against me.

19:129:003 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

19:129:004 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
           wicked.

19:129:005 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

19:129:006 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
           afore it groweth up:

19:129:007 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
           sheaves his bosom.

19:129:008 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
           upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

19:130:001 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

19:130:002 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice
           of my supplications.

19:130:003 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
           stand?

19:130:004 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
           feared.

19:130:005 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
           hope.

19:130:006 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
           morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

19:130:007 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
           and with him is plenteous redemption.

19:130:008 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

19:131:001 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do
           I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for
           me.

19:131:002 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
           weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

19:131:003 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.

19:132:001 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

19:132:002 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
           Jacob;

19:132:003 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
           up into my bed;

19:132:004 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine
           eyelids,

19:132:005 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
           mighty God of Jacob.

19:132:006 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of
           the wood.

19:132:007 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
           footstool.

19:132:008 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy
           strength.

19:132:009 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
           saints shout for joy.

19:132:010 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
           anointed.

19:132:011 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
           it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

19:132:012 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
           shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy
           throne for evermore.

19:132:013 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
           habitation.

19:132:014 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have
           desired it.

19:132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor
           with bread.

19:132:016 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints
           shall shout aloud for joy.

19:132:017 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a
           lamp for mine anointed.

19:132:018 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall
           his crown flourish.

19:133:001 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
           together in unity!

19:133:002 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
           upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the
           skirts of his garments;

19:133:003 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
           mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing,
           even life for evermore.

19:134:001 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which
           by night stand in the house of the LORD.

19:134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

19:134:003 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.

19:135:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise
           him, O ye servants of the LORD.

19:135:002 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the
           house of our God.

19:135:003 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his
           name; for it is pleasant.

19:135:004 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for
           his peculiar treasure.

19:135:005 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above
           all gods.

19:135:006 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
           earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

19:135:007 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
           he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of
           his treasuries.

19:135:008 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

19:135:009 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
           upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

19:135:010 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

19:135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
           kingdoms of Canaan:

19:135:012 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
           his people.

19:135:013 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
           throughout all generations.

19:135:014 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
           concerning his servants.

19:135:015 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of
           men's hands.

19:135:016 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
           see not;

19:135:017 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
           in their mouths.

19:135:018 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
           trusteth in them.

19:135:019 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of
           Aaron:

19:135:020 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless
           the LORD.

19:135:021 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
           Praise ye the LORD.

19:136:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:136:002 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for
           ever.

19:136:003 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for
           ever.

19:136:004 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:005 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:006 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:007 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for
           ever:

19:136:008 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:010 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy
           endureth for ever:

19:136:011 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth
           for ever:

19:136:012 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:013 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy
           endureth for ever:

19:136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy
           endureth for ever:

19:136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:016 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:017 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for
           ever:

19:136:018 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:020 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:021 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth
           for ever:

19:136:022 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth
           for ever:

19:136:024 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:025 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:026 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
           when we remembered Zion.

19:137:002 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

19:137:003 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
           song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,
           Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

19:137:004 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

19:137:005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
           cunning.

19:137:006 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
           my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

19:137:007 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of
           Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation
           thereof.

19:137:008 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he
           be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

19:137:009 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
           against the stones.

19:138:001 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I
           sing praise unto thee.

19:138:002 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
           thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified
           thy word above all thy name.

19:138:003 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst
           me with strength in my soul.

19:138:004 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when
           they hear the words of thy mouth.

19:138:005 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the
           glory of the LORD.

19:138:006 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:
           but the proud he knoweth afar off.

19:138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me:
           thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine
           enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.

19:138:008 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O
           LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own
           hands.

19:139:001 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.

19:139:002 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
           understandest my thought afar off.

19:139:003 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
           with all my ways.

19:139:004 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou
           knowest it altogether.

19:139:005 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon
           me.

19:139:006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
           attain unto it.

19:139:007 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee
           from thy presence?

19:139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed
           in hell, behold, thou art there.

19:139:009 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
           parts of the sea;

19:139:010 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
           hold me.

19:139:011 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
           shall be light about me.

19:139:012 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
           as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

19:139:013 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
           mother's womb.

19:139:014 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
           marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

19:139:015 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
           and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

19:139:016 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
           thy book all my members were written, which in continuance
           were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

19:139:017 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great
           is the sum of them!

19:139:018 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
           when I awake, I am still with thee.

19:139:019 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me
           therefore, ye bloody men.

19:139:020 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take
           thy name in vain.

19:139:021 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
           grieved with those that rise up against thee?

19:139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

19:139:023 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
           thoughts:

19:139:024 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
           way everlasting.

19:140:001 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the
           violent man;

19:140:002 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
           gathered together for war.

19:140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders'
           poison is under their lips. Selah.

19:140:004 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me
           from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my
           goings.

19:140:005 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread
           a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

19:140:006 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
           supplications, O LORD.

19:140:007 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast
           covered my head in the day of battle.

19:140:008 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his
           wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

19:140:009 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the
           mischief of their own lips cover them.

19:140:010 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the
           fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

19:140:011 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil
           shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

19:140:012 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
           and the right of the poor.

19:140:013 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the
           upright shall dwell in thy presence.

19:141:001 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my
           voice, when I cry unto thee.

19:141:002 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
           lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

19:141:003 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my
           lips.

19:141:004 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked
           works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their
           dainties.

19:141:005 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let
           him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not
           break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their
           calamities.

19:141:006 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall
           hear my words; for they are sweet.

19:141:007 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one
           cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

19:141:008 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my
           trust; leave not my soul destitute.

19:141:009 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the
           gins of the workers of iniquity.

19:141:010 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
           escape.

19:142:001 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the
           LORD did I make my supplication.

19:142:002 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
           trouble.

19:142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
           path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a
           snare for me.

19:142:004 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man
           that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my
           soul.

19:142:005 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my
           portion in the land of the living.

19:142:006 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from
           my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

19:142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
           righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal
           bountifully with me.

19:143:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
           faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

19:143:002 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
           shall no man living be justified.

19:143:003 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
           down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as
           those that have been long dead.

19:143:004 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within
           me is desolate.

19:143:005 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I
           muse on the work of thy hands.

19:143:006 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after
           thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

19:143:007 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face
           from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

19:143:008 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in
           thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should
           walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

19:143:009 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to
           hide me.

19:143:010 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is
           good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

19:143:011 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy
           righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

19:143:012 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
           that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.

19:144:001 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to
           war, and my fingers to fight:

19:144:002 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;
           my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people
           under me.

19:144:003 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the
           son of man, that thou makest account of him!

19:144:004 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth
           away.

19:144:005 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains,
           and they shall smoke.

19:144:006 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine
           arrows, and destroy them.

19:144:007 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of
           great waters, from the hand of strange children;

19:144:008 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
           hand of falsehood.

19:144:009 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and
           an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

19:144:010 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth
           David his servant from the hurtful sword.

19:144:011 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children,
           whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
           hand of falsehood:

19:144:012 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that
           our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the
           similitude of a palace:

19:144:013 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store:
           that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in
           our streets:

19:144:014 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no
           breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in
           our streets.

19:144:015 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is
           that people, whose God is the LORD.

19:145:001 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name
           for ever and ever.

19:145:002 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for
           ever and ever.

19:145:003 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his
           greatness is unsearchable.

19:145:004 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
           declare thy mighty acts.

19:145:005 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
           wondrous works.

19:145:006 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I
           will declare thy greatness.

19:145:007 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
           and shall sing of thy righteousness.

19:145:008 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger,
           and of great mercy.

19:145:009 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all
           his works.

19:145:010 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall
           bless thee.

19:145:011 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
           power;

19:145:012 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
           glorious majesty of his kingdom.

19:145:013 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
           endureth throughout all generations.

19:145:014 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those
           that be bowed down.

19:145:015 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their
           meat in due season.

19:145:016 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every
           living thing.

19:145:017 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
           works.

19:145:018 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
           call upon him in truth.

19:145:019 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
           hear their cry, and will save them.

19:145:020 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked
           will he destroy.

19:145:021 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh
           bless his holy name for ever and ever.

19:146:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

19:146:002 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto
           my God while I have any being.

19:146:003 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
           there is no help.

19:146:004 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
           very day his thoughts perish.

19:146:005 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose
           hope is in the LORD his God:

19:146:006 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein
           is: which keepeth truth for ever:

19:146:007 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food
           to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

19:146:008 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them
           that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

19:146:009 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
           and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

19:146:010 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
           generations. Praise ye the LORD.

19:147:001 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our
           God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

19:147:002 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the
           outcasts of Israel.

19:147:003 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

19:147:004 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by
           their names.

19:147:005 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
           infinite.

19:147:006 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to
           the ground.

19:147:007 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the
           harp unto our God:

19:147:008 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for
           the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

19:147:009 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
           cry.

19:147:010 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
           pleasure in the legs of a man.

19:147:011 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
           hope in his mercy.

19:147:012 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

19:147:013 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath
           blessed thy children within thee.

19:147:014 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
           finest of the wheat.

19:147:015 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
           very swiftly.

19:147:016 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
           ashes.

19:147:017 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before
           his cold?

19:147:018 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
           to blow, and the waters flow.

19:147:019 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
           unto Israel.

19:147:020 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his
           judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.

19:148:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens:
           praise him in the heights.

19:148:002 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

19:148:003 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of
           light.

19:148:004 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above
           the heavens.

19:148:005 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and
           they were created.

19:148:006 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
           decree which shall not pass.

19:148:007 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

19:148:008 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
           word:

19:148:009 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

19:148:010 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

19:148:011 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
           the earth:

19:148:012 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

19:148:013 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
           excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

19:148:014 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
           saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto
           him. Praise ye the LORD.

19:149:001 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
           praise in the congregation of saints.

19:149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of
           Zion be joyful in their King.

19:149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
           unto him with the timbrel and harp.

19:149:004 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify
           the meek with salvation.

19:149:005 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
           their beds.

19:149:006 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
           sword in their hand;

19:149:007 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon
           the people;

19:149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
           of iron;

19:149:009 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have
           all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.

19:150:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in
           the firmament of his power.

19:150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his
           excellent greatness.

19:150:003 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
           psaltery and harp.

19:150:004 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with
           stringed instruments and organs.

19:150:005 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
           sounding cymbals.

19:150:006 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye
           the LORD.

Book 20        Proverbs

20:001:001 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

20:001:002 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of
           understanding;

20:001:003 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment,
           and equity;

20:001:004 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
           discretion.

20:001:005 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
           understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

20:001:006 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of
           the wise, and their dark sayings.

20:001:007 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools
           despise wisdom and instruction.

20:001:008 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not
           the law of thy mother:

20:001:009 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and
           chains about thy neck.

20:001:010 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

20:001:011 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us
           lurk privily for the innocent without cause:

20:001:012 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those
           that go down into the pit:

20:001:013 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
           with spoil:

20:001:014 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:

20:001:015 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot
           from their path:

20:001:016 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

20:001:017 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

20:001:018 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for
           their own lives.

20:001:019 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which
           taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

20:001:020 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

20:001:021 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of
           the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,

20:001:022 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the
           scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

20:001:023 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto
           you, I will make known my words unto you.

20:001:024 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
           hand, and no man regarded;

20:001:025 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
           reproof:

20:001:026 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear
           cometh;

20:001:027 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction
           cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon
           you.

20:001:028 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they
           shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:

20:001:029 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of
           the LORD:

20:001:030 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

20:001:031 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
           filled with their own devices.

20:001:032 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
           prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

20:001:033 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
           quiet from fear of evil.

20:002:001 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
           commandments with thee;

20:002:002 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine
           heart to understanding;

20:002:003 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice
           for understanding;

20:002:004 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for
           hid treasures;

20:002:005 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the
           knowledge of God.

20:002:006 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge
           and understanding.

20:002:007 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler
           to them that walk uprightly.

20:002:008 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of
           his saints.

20:002:009 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
           equity; yea, every good path.

20:002:010 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is
           pleasant unto thy soul;

20:002:011 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

20:002:012 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man
           that speaketh froward things;

20:002:013 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of
           darkness;

20:002:014 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the
           wicked;

20:002:015 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:

20:002:016 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger
           which flattereth with her words;

20:002:017 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the
           covenant of her God.

20:002:018 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the
           dead.

20:002:019 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of
           the paths of life.

20:002:020 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the
           paths of the righteous.

20:002:021 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
           remain in it.

20:002:022 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
           transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

20:003:001 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
           commandments:

20:003:002 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add
           to thee.

20:003:003 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy
           neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

20:003:004 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight
           of God and man.

20:003:005 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto
           thine own understanding.

20:003:006 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
           paths.

20:003:007 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from
           evil.

20:003:008 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

20:003:009 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits
           of all thine increase:

20:003:010 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
           shall burst out with new wine.

20:003:011 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be
           weary of his correction:

20:003:012 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the
           son in whom he delighteth.

20:003:013 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
           understanding.

20:003:014 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
           silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

20:003:015 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou
           canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

20:003:016 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand
           riches and honour.

20:003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
           peace.

20:003:018 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and
           happy is every one that retaineth her.

20:003:019 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding
           hath he established the heavens.

20:003:020 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop
           down the dew.

20:003:021 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom
           and discretion:

20:003:022 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

20:003:023 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
           stumble.

20:003:024 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou
           shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

20:003:025 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
           wicked, when it cometh.

20:003:026 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot
           from being taken.

20:003:027 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in
           the power of thine hand to do it.

20:003:028 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow
           I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

20:003:029 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
           securely by thee.

20:003:030 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
           harm.

20:003:031 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

20:003:032 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is
           with the righteous.

20:003:033 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he
           blesseth the habitation of the just.

20:003:034 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
           lowly.

20:003:035 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion
           of fools.

20:004:001 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to
           know understanding.

20:004:002 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

20:004:003 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the
           sight of my mother.

20:004:004 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my
           words: keep my commandments, and live.

20:004:005 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline
           from the words of my mouth.

20:004:006 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and
           she shall keep thee.

20:004:007 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with
           all thy getting get understanding.

20:004:008 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to
           honour, when thou dost embrace her.

20:004:009 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
           glory shall she deliver to thee.

20:004:010 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy
           life shall be many.

20:004:011 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in
           right paths.

20:004:012 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when
           thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

20:004:013 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for
           she is thy life.

20:004:014 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way
           of evil men.

20:004:015 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

20:004:016 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
           sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

20:004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
           violence.

20:004:018 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
           more and more unto the perfect day.

20:004:019 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what
           they stumble.

20:004:020 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

20:004:021 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of
           thine heart.

20:004:022 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all
           their flesh.

20:004:023 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the
           issues of life.

20:004:024 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far
           from thee.

20:004:025 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look
           straight before thee.

20:004:026 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be
           established.

20:004:027 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot
           from evil.

20:005:001 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my
           understanding:

20:005:002 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep
           knowledge.

20:005:003 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her
           mouth is smoother than oil:

20:005:004 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

20:005:005 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

20:005:006 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are
           moveable, that thou canst not know them.

20:005:007 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
           words of my mouth.

20:005:008 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
           house:

20:005:009 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto
           the cruel:

20:005:010 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be
           in the house of a stranger;

20:005:011 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are
           consumed,

20:005:012 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised
           reproof;

20:005:013 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined
           mine ear to them that instructed me!

20:005:014 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and
           assembly.

20:005:015 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out
           of thine own well.

20:005:016 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in
           the streets.

20:005:017 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

20:005:018 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
           youth.

20:005:019 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her
           breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always
           with her love.

20:005:020 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
           and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

20:005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he
           pondereth all his goings.

20:005:022 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall
           be holden with the cords of his sins.

20:005:023 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his
           folly he shall go astray.

20:006:001 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast
           stricken thy hand with a stranger,

20:006:002 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken
           with the words of thy mouth.

20:006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come
           into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure
           thy friend.

20:006:004 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

20:006:005 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
           bird from the hand of the fowler.

20:006:006 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

20:006:007 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

20:006:008 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in
           the harvest.

20:006:009 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out
           of thy sleep?

20:006:010 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
           hands to sleep:

20:006:011 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want
           as an armed man.

20:006:012 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

20:006:013 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he
           teacheth with his fingers;

20:006:014 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;
           he soweth discord.

20:006:015 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he
           be broken without remedy.

20:006:016 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an
           abomination unto him:

20:006:017 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent
           blood,

20:006:018 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift
           in running to mischief,

20:006:019 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord
           among brethren.

20:006:020 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law
           of thy mother:

20:006:021 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy
           neck.

20:006:022 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it
           shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
           thee.

20:006:023 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and
           reproofs of instruction are the way of life:

20:006:024 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the
           tongue of a strange woman.

20:006:025 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take
           thee with her eyelids.

20:006:026 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of
           bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

20:006:027 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be
           burned?

20:006:028 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

20:006:029 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever
           toucheth her shall not be innocent.

20:006:030 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul
           when he is hungry;

20:006:031 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give
           all the substance of his house.

20:006:032 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
           understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

20:006:033 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not
           be wiped away.

20:006:034 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare
           in the day of vengeance.

20:006:035 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,
           though thou givest many gifts.

20:007:001 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

20:007:002 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of
           thine eye.

20:007:003 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
           heart.

20:007:004 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding
           thy kinswoman:

20:007:005 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the
           stranger which flattereth with her words.

20:007:006 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

20:007:007 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the
           youths, a young man void of understanding,

20:007:008 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the
           way to her house,

20:007:009 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

20:007:010 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an
           harlot, and subtil of heart.

20:007:011 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

20:007:012 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at
           every corner.)

20:007:013 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face
           said unto him,

20:007:014 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

20:007:015 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy
           face, and I have found thee.

20:007:016 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
           works, with fine linen of Egypt.

20:007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

20:007:018 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
           solace ourselves with loves.

20:007:019 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:

20:007:020 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at
           the day appointed.

20:007:021 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
           flattering of her lips she forced him.

20:007:022 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the
           slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

20:007:023 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the
           snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

20:007:024 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to
           the words of my mouth.

20:007:025 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her
           paths.

20:007:026 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have
           been slain by her.

20:007:027 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
           death.

20:008:001 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

20:008:002 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the
           places of the paths.

20:008:003 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the
           coming in at the doors.

20:008:004 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

20:008:005 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an
           understanding heart.

20:008:006 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of
           my lips shall be right things.

20:008:007 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an
           abomination to my lips.

20:008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is
           nothing froward or perverse in them.

20:008:009 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to
           them that find knowledge.

20:008:010 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather
           than choice gold.

20:008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may
           be desired are not to be compared to it.

20:008:012 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
           inventions.

20:008:013 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy,
           and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

20:008:014 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have
           strength.

20:008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

20:008:016 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the
           earth.

20:008:017 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall
           find me.

20:008:018 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and
           righteousness.

20:008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my
           revenue than choice silver.

20:008:020 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths
           of judgment:

20:008:021 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and
           I will fill their treasures.

20:008:022 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his
           works of old.

20:008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
           earth was.

20:008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there
           were no fountains abounding with water.

20:008:025 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
           brought forth:

20:008:026 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
           the highest part of the dust of the world.

20:008:027 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a
           compass upon the face of the depth:

20:008:028 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the
           fountains of the deep:

20:008:029 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not
           pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the
           earth:

20:008:030 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily
           his delight, rejoicing always before him;

20:008:031 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights
           were with the sons of men.

20:008:032 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are
           they that keep my ways.

20:008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

20:008:034 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my
           gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

20:008:035 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of
           the LORD.

20:008:036 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they
           that hate me love death.

20:009:001 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven
           pillars:

20:009:002 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she
           hath also furnished her table.

20:009:003 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest
           places of the city,

20:009:004 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that
           wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

20:009:005 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have
           mingled.

20:009:006 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of
           understanding.

20:009:007 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he
           that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.

20:009:008 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man,
           and he will love thee.

20:009:009 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:
           teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

20:009:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the
           knowledge of the holy is understanding.

20:009:011 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy
           life shall be increased.

20:009:012 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou
           scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

20:009:013 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth
           nothing.

20:009:014 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the
           high places of the city,

20:009:015 To call passengers who go right on their ways:

20:009:016 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that
           wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

20:009:017 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is
           pleasant.

20:009:018 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her
           guests are in the depths of hell.

20:010:001 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but
           a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

20:010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness
           delivereth from death.

20:010:003 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
           but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.

20:010:004 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand
           of the diligent maketh rich.

20:010:005 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that
           sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.

20:010:006 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth
           the mouth of the wicked.

20:010:007 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked
           shall rot.

20:010:008 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating
           fool shall fall.

20:010:009 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that
           perverteth his ways shall be known.

20:010:010 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating
           fool shall fall.

20:010:011 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence
           covereth the mouth of the wicked.

20:010:012 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

20:010:013 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
           but a rod is for the back of him that is void of
           understanding.

20:010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is
           near destruction.

20:010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of
           the poor is their poverty.

20:010:016 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the
           wicked to sin.

20:010:017 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
           refuseth reproof erreth.

20:010:018 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
           slander, is a fool.

20:010:019 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that
           refraineth his lips is wise.

20:010:020 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the
           wicked is little worth.

20:010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of
           wisdom.

20:010:022 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
           sorrow with it.

20:010:023 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
           understanding hath wisdom.

20:010:024 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire
           of the righteous shall be granted.

20:010:025 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the
           righteous is an everlasting foundation.

20:010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
           sluggard to them that send him.

20:010:027 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the
           wicked shall be shortened.

20:010:028 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the
           expectation of the wicked shall perish.

20:010:029 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but
           destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.

20:010:030 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not
           inhabit the earth.

20:010:031 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward
           tongue shall be cut out.

20:010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the
           mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.

20:011:001 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight
           is his delight.

20:011:002 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is
           wisdom.

20:011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the
           perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

20:011:004 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness
           delivereth from death.

20:011:005 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the
           wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

20:011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but
           transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.

20:011:007 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the
           hope of unjust men perisheth.

20:011:008 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
           cometh in his stead.

20:011:009 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but
           through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

20:011:010 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and
           when the wicked perish, there is shouting.

20:011:011 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is
           overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

20:011:012 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man
           of understanding holdeth his peace.

20:011:013 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful
           spirit concealeth the matter.

20:011:014 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of
           counsellors there is safety.

20:011:015 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he
           that hateth suretiship is sure.

20:011:016 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain
           riches.

20:011:017 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is
           cruel troubleth his own flesh.

20:011:018 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth
           righteousness shall be a sure reward.

20:011:019 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil
           pursueth it to his own death.

20:011:020 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:
           but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

20:011:021 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:
           but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

20:011:022 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman
           which is without discretion.

20:011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation
           of the wicked is wrath.

20:011:024 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is
           that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.

20:011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall
           be watered also himself.

20:011:026 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but
           blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.

20:011:027 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that
           seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

20:011:028 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous
           shall flourish as a branch.

20:011:029 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and
           the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.

20:011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that
           winneth souls is wise.

20:011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much
           more the wicked and the sinner.

20:012:001 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth
           reproof is brutish.

20:012:002 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked
           devices will he condemn.

20:012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of
           the righteous shall not be moved.

20:012:004 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that
           maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.

20:012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of
           the wicked are deceit.

20:012:006 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the
           mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

20:012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the
           righteous shall stand.

20:012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that
           is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

20:012:009 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he
           that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

20:012:010 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the
           tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

20:012:011 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he
           that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.

20:012:012 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the
           righteous yieldeth fruit.

20:012:013 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the
           just shall come out of trouble.

20:012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:
           and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto
           him.

20:012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that
           hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.

20:012:016 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth
           shame.

20:012:017 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a
           false witness deceit.

20:012:018 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the
           tongue of the wise is health.

20:012:019 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying
           tongue is but for a moment.

20:012:020 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the
           counsellors of peace is joy.

20:012:021 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall
           be filled with mischief.

20:012:022 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal
           truly are his delight.

20:012:023 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools
           proclaimeth foolishness.

20:012:024 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful
           shall be under tribute.

20:012:025 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word
           maketh it glad.

20:012:026 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the
           way of the wicked seduceth them.

20:012:027 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
           but the substance of a diligent man is precious.

20:012:028 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway
           thereof there is no death.

20:013:001 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner
           heareth not rebuke.

20:013:002 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul
           of the transgressors shall eat violence.

20:013:003 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that
           openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.

20:013:004 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the
           soul of the diligent shall be made fat.

20:013:005 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome,
           and cometh to shame.

20:013:006 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but
           wickedness overthroweth the sinner.

20:013:007 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is
           that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.

20:013:008 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor
           heareth not rebuke.

20:013:009 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the
           wicked shall be put out.

20:013:010 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is
           wisdom.

20:013:011 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that
           gathereth by labour shall increase.

20:013:012 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire
           cometh, it is a tree of life.

20:013:013 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that
           feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.

20:013:014 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the
           snares of death.

20:013:015 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors
           is hard.

20:013:016 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth
           open his folly.

20:013:017 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful
           ambassador is health.

20:013:018 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:
           but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.

20:013:019 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is
           abomination to fools to depart from evil.

20:013:020 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion
           of fools shall be destroyed.

20:013:021 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be
           repayed.

20:013:022 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:
           and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.

20:013:023 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is
           destroyed for want of judgment.

20:013:024 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him
           chasteneth him betimes.

20:013:025 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the
           belly of the wicked shall want.

20:014:001 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh
           it down with her hands.

20:014:002 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he
           that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.

20:014:003 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of
           the wise shall preserve them.

20:014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by
           the strength of the ox.

20:014:005 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will
           utter lies.

20:014:006 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is
           easy unto him that understandeth.

20:014:007 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest
           not in him the lips of knowledge.

20:014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the
           folly of fools is deceit.

20:014:009 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is
           favour.

20:014:010 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
           intermeddle with his joy.

20:014:011 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the
           tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.

20:014:012 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end
           thereof are the ways of death.

20:014:013 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that
           mirth is heaviness.

20:014:014 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and
           a good man shall be satisfied from himself.

20:014:015 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh
           well to his going.

20:014:016 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool
           rageth, and is confident.

20:014:017 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked
           devices is hated.

20:014:018 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with
           knowledge.

20:014:019 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of
           the righteous.

20:014:020 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath
           many friends.

20:014:021 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath
           mercy on the poor, happy is he.

20:014:022 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be
           to them that devise good.

20:014:023 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips
           tendeth only to penury.

20:014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of
           fools is folly.

20:014:025 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness
           speaketh lies.

20:014:026 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children
           shall have a place of refuge.

20:014:027 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the
           snares of death.

20:014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the
           want of people is the destruction of the prince.

20:014:029 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he
           that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

20:014:030 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the
           rottenness of the bones.

20:014:031 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that
           honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

20:014:032 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous
           hath hope in his death.

20:014:033 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
           but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.

20:014:034 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any
           people.

20:014:035 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is
           against him that causeth shame.

20:015:001 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
           anger.

20:015:002 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth
           of fools poureth out foolishness.

20:015:003 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil
           and the good.

20:015:004 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein
           is a breach in the spirit.

20:015:005 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that
           regardeth reproof is prudent.

20:015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the
           revenues of the wicked is trouble.

20:015:007 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the
           foolish doeth not so.

20:015:008 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but
           the prayer of the upright is his delight.

20:015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he
           loveth him that followeth after righteousness.

20:015:010 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he
           that hateth reproof shall die.

20:015:011 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then
           the hearts of the children of men?

20:015:012 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he
           go unto the wise.

20:015:013 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of
           the heart the spirit is broken.

20:015:014 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
           but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.

20:015:015 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a
           merry heart hath a continual feast.

20:015:016 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
           and trouble therewith.

20:015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox
           and hatred therewith.

20:015:018 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to
           anger appeaseth strife.

20:015:019 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the
           way of the righteous is made plain.

20:015:020 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth
           his mother.

20:015:021 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of
           understanding walketh uprightly.

20:015:022 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the
           multitude of counsellors they are established.

20:015:023 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken
           in due season, how good is it!

20:015:024 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from
           hell beneath.

20:015:025 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will
           establish the border of the widow.

20:015:026 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but
           the words of the pure are pleasant words.

20:015:027 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that
           hateth gifts shall live.

20:015:028 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth
           of the wicked poureth out evil things.

20:015:029 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of
           the righteous.

20:015:030 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report
           maketh the bones fat.

20:015:031 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the
           wise.

20:015:032 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he
           that heareth reproof getteth understanding.

20:015:033 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before
           honour is humility.

20:016:001 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the
           tongue, is from the LORD.

20:016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD
           weigheth the spirits.

20:016:003 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be
           established.

20:016:004 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the
           wicked for the day of evil.

20:016:005 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the
           LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

20:016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the
           LORD men depart from evil.

20:016:007 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies
           to be at peace with him.

20:016:008 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues
           without right.

20:016:009 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his
           steps.

20:016:010 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth
           transgresseth not in judgment.

20:016:011 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of
           the bag are his work.

20:016:012 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the
           throne is established by righteousness.

20:016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him
           that speaketh right.

20:016:014 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man
           will pacify it.

20:016:015 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour
           is as a cloud of the latter rain.

20:016:016 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get
           understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

20:016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that
           keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

20:016:018 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a
           fall.

20:016:019 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
           divide the spoil with the proud.

20:016:020 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso
           trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

20:016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness
           of the lips increaseth learning.

20:016:022 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
           but the instruction of fools is folly.

20:016:023 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning
           to his lips.

20:016:024 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and
           health to the bones.

20:016:025 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end
           thereof are the ways of death.

20:016:026 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth
           it of him.

20:016:027 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a
           burning fire.

20:016:028 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief
           friends.

20:016:029 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the
           way that is not good.

20:016:030 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips
           he bringeth evil to pass.

20:016:031 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way
           of righteousness.

20:016:032 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he
           that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

20:016:033 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof
           is of the LORD.

20:017:001 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house
           full of sacrifices with strife.

20:017:002 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
           and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

20:017:003 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but
           the LORD trieth the hearts.

20:017:004 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear
           to a naughty tongue.

20:017:005 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is
           glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

20:017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of
           children are their fathers.

20:017:007 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips
           a prince.

20:017:008 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
           whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

20:017:009 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that
           repeateth a matter separateth very friends.

20:017:010 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred
           stripes into a fool.

20:017:011 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel
           messenger shall be sent against him.

20:017:012 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool
           in his folly.

20:017:013 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his
           house.

20:017:014 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
           therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

20:017:015 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the
           just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.

20:017:016 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get
           wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?

20:017:017 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for
           adversity.

20:017:018 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh
           surety in the presence of his friend.

20:017:019 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that
           exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.

20:017:020 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath
           a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

20:017:021 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the
           father of a fool hath no joy.

20:017:022 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit
           drieth the bones.

20:017:023 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the
           ways of judgment.

20:017:024 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of
           a fool are in the ends of the earth.

20:017:025 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her
           that bare him.

20:017:026 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
           equity.

20:017:027 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of
           understanding is of an excellent spirit.

20:017:028 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and
           he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

20:018:001 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and
           intermeddleth with all wisdom.

20:018:002 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart
           may discover itself.

20:018:003 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with
           ignominy reproach.

20:018:004 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the
           wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.

20:018:005 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to
           overthrow the righteous in judgment.

20:018:006 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for
           strokes.

20:018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare
           of his soul.

20:018:008 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
           the innermost parts of the belly.

20:018:009 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is
           a great waster.

20:018:010 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth
           into it, and is safe.

20:018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall
           in his own conceit.

20:018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before
           honour is humility.

20:018:013 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly
           and shame unto him.

20:018:014 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded
           spirit who can bear?

20:018:015 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the
           wise seeketh knowledge.

20:018:016 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before
           great men.

20:018:017 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his
           neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

20:018:018 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
           mighty.

20:018:019 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and
           their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

20:018:020 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
           and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

20:018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that
           love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

20:018:022 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth
           favour of the LORD.

20:018:023 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

20:018:024 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there
           is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

20:019:001 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that
           is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

20:019:002 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and
           he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.

20:019:003 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart
           fretteth against the LORD.

20:019:004 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
           neighbour.

20:019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
           lies shall not escape.

20:019:006 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a
           friend to him that giveth gifts.

20:019:007 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his
           friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they
           are wanting to him.

20:019:008 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth
           understanding shall find good.

20:019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
           lies shall perish.

20:019:010 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to
           have rule over princes.

20:019:011 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his
           glory to pass over a transgression.

20:019:012 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour
           is as dew upon the grass.

20:019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the
           contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

20:019:014 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent
           wife is from the LORD.

20:019:015 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall
           suffer hunger.

20:019:016 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he
           that despiseth his ways shall die.

20:019:017 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and
           that which he hath given will he pay him again.

20:019:018 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul
           spare for his crying.

20:019:019 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou
           deliver him, yet thou must do it again.

20:019:020 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be
           wise in thy latter end.

20:019:021 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the
           counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

20:019:022 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better
           than a liar.

20:019:023 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it
           shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

20:019:024 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so
           much as bring it to his mouth again.

20:019:025 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one
           that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

20:019:026 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a
           son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

20:019:027 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err
           from the words of knowledge.

20:019:028 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the
           wicked devoureth iniquity.

20:019:029 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back
           of fools.

20:020:001 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is
           deceived thereby is not wise.

20:020:002 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso
           provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.

20:020:003 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool
           will be meddling.

20:020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore
           shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

20:020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of
           understanding will draw it out.

20:020:006 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a
           faithful man who can find?

20:020:007 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are
           blessed after him.

20:020:008 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away
           all evil with his eyes.

20:020:009 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
           sin?

20:020:010 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike
           abomination to the LORD.

20:020:011 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,
           and whether it be right.

20:020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even
           both of them.

20:020:013 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes,
           and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

20:020:014 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is
           gone his way, then he boasteth.

20:020:015 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of
           knowledge are a precious jewel.

20:020:016 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a
           pledge of him for a strange woman.

20:020:017 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth
           shall be filled with gravel.

20:020:018 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice
           make war.

20:020:019 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
           therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

20:020:020 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put
           out in obscure darkness.

20:020:021 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the
           end thereof shall not be blessed.

20:020:022 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD,
           and he shall save thee.

20:020:023 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false
           balance is not good.

20:020:024 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand
           his own way?

20:020:025 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and
           after vows to make enquiry.

20:020:026 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over
           them.

20:020:027 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the
           inward parts of the belly.

20:020:028 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden
           by mercy.

20:020:029 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of
           old men is the grey head.

20:020:030 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the
           inward parts of the belly.

20:021:001 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of
           water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

20:021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD
           pondereth the hearts.

20:021:003 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
           sacrifice.

20:021:004 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the
           wicked, is sin.

20:021:005 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but
           of every one that is hasty only to want.

20:021:006 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed
           to and fro of them that seek death.

20:021:007 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they
           refuse to do judgment.

20:021:008 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure,
           his work is right.

20:021:009 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a
           brawling woman in a wide house.

20:021:010 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no
           favour in his eyes.

20:021:011 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and
           when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

20:021:012 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
           but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.

20:021:013 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall
           cry himself, but shall not be heard.

20:021:014 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom
           strong wrath.

20:021:015 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be
           to the workers of iniquity.

20:021:016 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
           remain in the congregation of the dead.

20:021:017 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth
           wine and oil shall not be rich.

20:021:018 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the
           transgressor for the upright.

20:021:019 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a
           contentious and an angry woman.

20:021:020 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
           wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

20:021:021 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,
           righteousness, and honour.

20:021:022 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down
           the strength of the confidence thereof.

20:021:023 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
           troubles.

20:021:024 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud
           wrath.

20:021:025 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse
           to labour.

20:021:026 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous
           giveth and spareth not.

20:021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more,
           when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?

20:021:028 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth
           speaketh constantly.

20:021:029 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he
           directeth his way.

20:021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the
           LORD.

20:021:031 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is
           of the LORD.

20:022:001 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and
           loving favour rather than silver and gold.

20:022:002 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them
           all.

20:022:003 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the
           simple pass on, and are punished.

20:022:004 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour,
           and life.

20:022:005 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth
           keep his soul shall be far from them.

20:022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
           he will not depart from it.

20:022:007 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to
           the lender.

20:022:008 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his
           anger shall fail.

20:022:009 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth
           of his bread to the poor.

20:022:010 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife
           and reproach shall cease.

20:022:011 He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips
           the king shall be his friend.

20:022:012 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth
           the words of the transgressor.

20:022:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be
           slain in the streets.

20:022:014 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred
           of the LORD shall fall therein.

20:022:015 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of
           correction shall drive it far from him.

20:022:016 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he
           that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.

20:022:017 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply
           thine heart unto my knowledge.

20:022:018 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they
           shall withal be fitted in thy lips.

20:022:019 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee
           this day, even to thee.

20:022:020 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
           knowledge,

20:022:021 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of
           truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them
           that send unto thee?

20:022:022 Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the
           afflicted in the gate:

20:022:023 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of
           those that spoiled them.

20:022:024 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man
           thou shalt not go:

20:022:025 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

20:022:026 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are
           sureties for debts.

20:022:027 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed
           from under thee?

20:022:028 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.

20:022:029 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand
           before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.

20:023:001 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently
           what is before thee:

20:023:002 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to
           appetite.

20:023:003 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

20:023:004 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

20:023:005 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches
           certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle
           toward heaven.

20:023:006 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither
           desire thou his dainty meats:

20:023:007 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink,
           saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

20:023:008 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose
           thy sweet words.

20:023:009 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the
           wisdom of thy words.

20:023:010 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of
           the fatherless:

20:023:011 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
           thee.

20:023:012 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the
           words of knowledge.

20:023:013 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest
           him with the rod, he shall not die.

20:023:014 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul
           from hell.

20:023:015 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even
           mine.

20:023:016 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

20:023:017 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of
           the LORD all the day long.

20:023:018 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be
           cut off.

20:023:019 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the
           way.

20:023:020 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

20:023:021 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and
           drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

20:023:022 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy
           mother when she is old.

20:023:023 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,
           and understanding.

20:023:024 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that
           begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.

20:023:025 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare
           thee shall rejoice.

20:023:026 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my
           ways.

20:023:027 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow
           pit.

20:023:028 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
           transgressors among men.

20:023:029 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath
           babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of
           eyes?

20:023:030 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed
           wine.

20:023:031 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his
           colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

20:023:032 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an
           adder.

20:023:033 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall
           utter perverse things.

20:023:034 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the
           sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

20:023:035 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick;
           they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I
           will seek it yet again.

20:024:001 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be
           with them.

20:024:002 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of
           mischief.

20:024:003 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is
           established:

20:024:004 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all
           precious and pleasant riches.

20:024:005 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth
           strength.

20:024:006 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude
           of counsellors there is safety.

20:024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the
           gate.

20:024:008 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous
           person.

20:024:009 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an
           abomination to men.

20:024:010 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

20:024:011 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and
           those that are ready to be slain;

20:024:012 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that
           pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul,
           doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man
           according to his works?

20:024:013 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb,
           which is sweet to thy taste:

20:024:014 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou
           hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy
           expectation shall not be cut off.

20:024:015 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the
           righteous; spoil not his resting place:

20:024:016 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but
           the wicked shall fall into mischief.

20:024:017 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart
           be glad when he stumbleth:

20:024:018 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away
           his wrath from him.

20:024:019 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious
           at the wicked:

20:024:020 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of
           the wicked shall be put out.

20:024:021 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with
           them that are given to change:

20:024:022 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the
           ruin of them both?

20:024:023 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have
           respect of persons in judgment.

20:024:024 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall
           the people curse, nations shall abhor him:

20:024:025 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good
           blessing shall come upon them.

20:024:026 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.

20:024:027 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the
           field; and afterwards build thine house.

20:024:028 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and
           deceive not with thy lips.

20:024:029 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will
           render to the man according to his work.

20:024:030 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
           the man void of understanding;

20:024:031 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had
           covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was
           broken down.

20:024:032 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and
           received instruction.

20:024:033 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
           hands to sleep:

20:024:034 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want
           as an armed man.

20:025:001 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
           king of Judah copied out.

20:025:002 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of
           kings is to search out a matter.

20:025:003 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart
           of kings is unsearchable.

20:025:004 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come
           forth a vessel for the finer.

20:025:005 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne
           shall be established in righteousness.

20:025:006 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand
           not in the place of great men:

20:025:007 For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
           than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the
           prince whom thine eyes have seen.

20:025:008 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do
           in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

20:025:009 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not
           a secret to another:

20:025:010 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy
           turn not away.

20:025:011 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of
           silver.

20:025:012 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a
           wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

20:025:013 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
           messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of
           his masters.

20:025:014 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind
           without rain.

20:025:015 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue
           breaketh the bone.

20:025:016 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
           lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

20:025:017 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary
           of thee, and so hate thee.

20:025:018 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a
           maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.

20:025:019 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a
           broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.

20:025:020 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as
           vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy
           heart.

20:025:021 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
           thirsty, give him water to drink:

20:025:022 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD
           shall reward thee.

20:025:023 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance
           a backbiting tongue.

20:025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with
           a brawling woman and in a wide house.

20:025:025 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
           country.

20:025:026 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a
           troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.

20:025:027 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their
           own glory is not glory.

20:025:028 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that
           is broken down, and without walls.

20:026:001 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not
           seemly for a fool.

20:026:002 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the
           curse causeless shall not come.

20:026:003 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
           fool's back.

20:026:004 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be
           like unto him.

20:026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his
           own conceit.

20:026:006 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off
           the feet, and drinketh damage.

20:026:007 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the
           mouth of fools.

20:026:008 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth
           honour to a fool.

20:026:009 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a
           parable in the mouths of fools.

20:026:010 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool,
           and rewardeth transgressors.

20:026:011 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his
           folly.

20:026:012 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope
           of a fool than of him.

20:026:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is
           in the streets.

20:026:014 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon
           his bed.

20:026:015 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to
           bring it again to his mouth.

20:026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that
           can render a reason.

20:026:017 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to
           him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.

20:026:018 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

20:026:019 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not
           I in sport?

20:026:020 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is
           no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

20:026:021 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a
           contentious man to kindle strife.

20:026:022 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
           the innermost parts of the belly.

20:026:023 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered
           with silver dross.

20:026:024 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
           within him;

20:026:025 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven
           abominations in his heart.

20:026:026 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
           shewed before the whole congregation.

20:026:027 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a
           stone, it will return upon him.

20:026:028 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a
           flattering mouth worketh ruin.

20:027:001 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a
           day may bring forth.

20:027:002 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a
           stranger, and not thine own lips.

20:027:003 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is
           heavier than them both.

20:027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to
           stand before envy?

20:027:005 Open rebuke is better than secret love.

20:027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an
           enemy are deceitful.

20:027:007 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul
           every bitter thing is sweet.

20:027:008 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that
           wandereth from his place.

20:027:009 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness
           of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

20:027:010 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
           neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy
           calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a
           brother far off.

20:027:011 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him
           that reproacheth me.

20:027:012 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the
           simple pass on, and are punished.

20:027:013 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a
           pledge of him for a strange woman.

20:027:014 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in
           the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

20:027:015 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious
           woman are alike.

20:027:016 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
           right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

20:027:017 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of
           his friend.

20:027:018 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
           that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

20:027:019 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
           man.

20:027:020 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are
           never satisfied.

20:027:021 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is
           a man to his praise.

20:027:022 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with
           a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

20:027:023 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look
           well to thy herds.

20:027:024 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to
           every generation?

20:027:025 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and
           herbs of the mountains are gathered.

20:027:026 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of
           the field.

20:027:027 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the
           food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy
           maidens.

20:028:001 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are
           bold as a lion.

20:028:002 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:
           but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof
           shall be prolonged.

20:028:003 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain
           which leaveth no food.

20:028:004 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep
           the law contend with them.

20:028:005 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD
           understand all things.

20:028:006 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he
           that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.

20:028:007 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a
           companion of riotous men shameth his father.

20:028:008 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he
           shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

20:028:009 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his
           prayer shall be abomination.

20:028:010 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he
           shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall
           have good things in possession.

20:028:011 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that
           hath understanding searcheth him out.

20:028:012 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when
           the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

20:028:013 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
           confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

20:028:014 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his
           heart shall fall into mischief.

20:028:015 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler
           over the poor people.

20:028:016 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great
           oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his
           days.

20:028:017 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall
           flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

20:028:018 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is
           perverse in his ways shall fall at once.

20:028:019 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he
           that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.

20:028:020 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh
           haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

20:028:021 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of
           bread that man will transgress.

20:028:022 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth
           not that poverty shall come upon him.

20:028:023 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than
           he that flattereth with the tongue.

20:028:024 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no
           transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.

20:028:025 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that
           putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

20:028:026 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh
           wisely, he shall be delivered.

20:028:027 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that
           hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

20:028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they
           perish, the righteous increase.

20:029:001 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall
           suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.

20:029:002 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but
           when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

20:029:003 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth
           company with harlots spendeth his substance.

20:029:004 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that
           receiveth gifts overthroweth it.

20:029:005 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his
           feet.

20:029:006 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the
           righteous doth sing and rejoice.

20:029:007 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the
           wicked regardeth not to know it.

20:029:008 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away
           wrath.

20:029:009 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage
           or laugh, there is no rest.

20:029:010 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.

20:029:011 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in
           till afterwards.

20:029:012 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.

20:029:013 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD
           lighteneth both their eyes.

20:029:014 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be
           established for ever.

20:029:015 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself
           bringeth his mother to shame.

20:029:016 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but
           the righteous shall see their fall.

20:029:017 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall
           give delight unto thy soul.

20:029:018 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that
           keepeth the law, happy is he.

20:029:019 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he
           understand he will not answer.

20:029:020 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more
           hope of a fool than of him.

20:029:021 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall
           have him become his son at the length.

20:029:022 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth
           in transgression.

20:029:023 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the
           humble in spirit.

20:029:024 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth
           cursing, and bewrayeth it not.

20:029:025 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust
           in the LORD shall be safe.

20:029:026 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh
           from the LORD.

20:029:027 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is
           upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

20:030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man
           spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

20:030:002 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the
           understanding of a man.

20:030:003 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

20:030:004 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath
           gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a
           garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what
           is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?

20:030:005 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put
           their trust in him.

20:030:006 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be
           found a liar.

20:030:007 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I
           die:

20:030:008 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty
           nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

20:030:009 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or
           lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in
           vain.

20:030:010 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and
           thou be found guilty.

20:030:011 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not
           bless their mother.

20:030:012 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet
           is not washed from their filthiness.

20:030:013 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their
           eyelids are lifted up.

20:030:014 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their
           jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth,
           and the needy from among men.

20:030:015 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There
           are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things
           say not, It is enough:

20:030:016 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled
           with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.

20:030:017 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
           mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the
           young eagles shall eat it.

20:030:018 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea,
           four which I know not:

20:030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a
           rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way
           of a man with a maid.

20:030:020 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth
           her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

20:030:021 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which
           it cannot bear:

20:030:022 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled
           with meat;

20:030:023 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that
           is heir to her mistress.

20:030:024 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they
           are exceeding wise:

20:030:025 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat
           in the summer;

20:030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
           in the rocks;

20:030:027 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by
           bands;

20:030:028 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings'
           palaces.

20:030:029 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in
           going:

20:030:030 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away
           for any;

20:030:031 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there
           is no rising up.

20:030:032 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou
           hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.

20:030:033 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the
           wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of
           wrath bringeth forth strife.

20:031:001 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught
           him.

20:031:002 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son
           of my vows?

20:031:003 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which
           destroyeth kings.

20:031:004 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink
           wine; nor for princes strong drink:

20:031:005 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment
           of any of the afflicted.

20:031:006 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine
           unto those that be of heavy hearts.

20:031:007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery
           no more.

20:031:008 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are
           appointed to destruction.

20:031:009 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the
           poor and needy.

20:031:010 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
           rubies.

20:031:011 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he
           shall have no need of spoil.

20:031:012 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

20:031:013 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her
           hands.

20:031:014 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from
           afar.

20:031:015 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her
           household, and a portion to her maidens.

20:031:016 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her
           hands she planteth a vineyard.

20:031:017 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her
           arms.

20:031:018 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
           not out by night.

20:031:019 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
           distaff.

20:031:020 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth
           forth her hands to the needy.

20:031:021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
           household are clothed with scarlet.

20:031:022 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk
           and purple.

20:031:023 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
           elders of the land.

20:031:024 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
           unto the merchant.

20:031:025 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in
           time to come.

20:031:026 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the
           law of kindness.

20:031:027 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not
           the bread of idleness.

20:031:028 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
           and he praiseth her.

20:031:029 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
           all.

20:031:030 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
           feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

20:031:031 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works
           praise her in the gates.

Book 21        Ecclesiastes

21:001:001 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in
           Jerusalem.

21:001:002 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;
           all is vanity.

21:001:003 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under
           the sun?

21:001:004 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:
           but the earth abideth for ever.

21:001:005 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to
           his place where he arose.

21:001:006 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the
           north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth
           again according to his circuits.

21:001:007 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto
           the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
           again.

21:001:008 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is
           not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

21:001:009 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
           which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new
           thing under the sun.

21:001:010 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
           it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

21:001:011 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there
           be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that
           shall come after.

21:001:012 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

21:001:013 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
           concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore
           travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised
           therewith.

21:001:014 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
           behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

21:001:015 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which
           is wanting cannot be numbered.

21:001:016 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
           estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have
           been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great
           experience of wisdom and knowledge.

21:001:017 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
           folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

21:001:018 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
           knowledge increaseth sorrow.

21:002:001 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
           therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

21:002:002 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

21:002:003 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet
           acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly,
           till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which
           they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

21:002:004 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
           vineyards:

21:002:005 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of
           all kind of fruits:

21:002:006 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
           bringeth forth trees:

21:002:007 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
           house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
           above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

21:002:008 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
           of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
           singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
           instruments, and that of all sorts.

21:002:009 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
           me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

21:002:010 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I
           withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in
           all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

21:002:011 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and
           on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was
           vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under
           the sun.

21:002:012 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:
           for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
           which hath been already done.

21:002:013 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light
           excelleth darkness.

21:002:014 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
           darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth
           to them all.

21:002:015 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
           happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I
           said in my heart, that this also is vanity.

21:002:016 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool
           for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall
           all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

21:002:017 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
           the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of
           spirit.

21:002:018 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
           because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

21:002:019 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
           shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured,
           and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is
           also vanity.

21:002:020 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
           labour which I took under the sun.

21:002:021 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in
           knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured
           therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity
           and a great evil.

21:002:022 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of
           his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

21:002:023 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his
           heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

21:002:024 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
           drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his
           labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

21:002:025 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?

21:002:026 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
           knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to
           gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good
           before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

21:003:001 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
           under the heaven:

21:003:002 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a
           time to pluck up that which is planted;

21:003:003 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and
           a time to build up;

21:003:004 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
           time to dance;

21:003:005 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones
           together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
           embracing;

21:003:006 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
           to cast away;

21:003:007 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and
           a time to speak;

21:003:008 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time
           of peace.

21:003:009 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

21:003:010 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of
           men to be exercised in it.

21:003:011 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath
           set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the
           work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

21:003:012 I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to
           rejoice, and to do good in his life.

21:003:013 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the
           good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

21:003:014 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever:
           nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God
           doeth it, that men should fear before him.

21:003:015 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath
           already been; and God requireth that which is past.

21:003:016 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
           wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that
           iniquity was there.

21:003:017 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
           wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for
           every work.

21:003:018 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
           that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
           they themselves are beasts.

21:003:019 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
           even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
           other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
           preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.

21:003:020 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
           dust again.

21:003:021 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the
           spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

21:003:022 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a
           man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion:
           for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

21:004:001 So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are
           done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were
           oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
           oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.

21:004:002 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than
           the living which are yet alive.

21:004:003 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who
           hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

21:004:004 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that
           for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity
           and vexation of spirit.

21:004:005 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

21:004:006 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full
           with travail and vexation of spirit.

21:004:007 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

21:004:008 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
           neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his
           labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither
           saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?
           This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.

21:004:009 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for
           their labour.

21:004:010 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to
           him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to
           help him up.

21:004:011 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can
           one be warm alone?

21:004:012 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
           threefold cord is not quickly broken.

21:004:013 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish
           king, who will no more be admonished.

21:004:014 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
           born in his kingdom becometh poor.

21:004:015 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
           second child that shall stand up in his stead.

21:004:016 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been
           before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in
           him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

21:005:001 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
           ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they
           consider not that they do evil.

21:005:002 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty
           to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou
           upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

21:005:003 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a
           fool's voice is known by multitude of words.

21:005:004 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he
           hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

21:005:005 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
           shouldest vow and not pay.

21:005:006 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say
           thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should
           God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine
           hands?

21:005:007 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also
           divers vanities: but fear thou God.

21:005:008 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent
           perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not
           at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest
           regardeth; and there be higher than they.

21:005:009 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself
           is served by the field.

21:005:010 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor
           he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

21:005:011 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and
           what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
           of them with their eyes?

21:005:012 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little
           or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
           sleep.

21:005:013 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
           riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

21:005:014 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a
           son, and there is nothing in his hand.

21:005:015 As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return
           to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which
           he may carry away in his hand.

21:005:016 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came,
           so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for
           the wind?

21:005:017 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much
           sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

21:005:018 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one
           to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
           that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
           God giveth him: for it is his portion.

21:005:019 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and
           hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
           and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

21:005:020 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because
           God answereth him in the joy of his heart.

21:006:001 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is
           common among men:

21:006:002 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so
           that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,
           yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger
           eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

21:006:003 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so
           that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled
           with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an
           untimely birth is better than he.

21:006:004 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and
           his name shall be covered with darkness.

21:006:005 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this
           hath more rest than the other.

21:006:006 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he
           seen no good: do not all go to one place?

21:006:007 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
           is not filled.

21:006:008 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
           that knoweth to walk before the living?

21:006:009 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
           desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

21:006:010 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it
           is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than
           he.

21:006:011 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man
           the better?

21:006:012 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the
           days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who
           can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?

21:007:001 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of
           death than the day of one's birth.

21:007:002 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
           house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the
           living will lay it to his heart.

21:007:003 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
           countenance the heart is made better.

21:007:004 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the
           heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

21:007:005 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
           hear the song of fools.

21:007:006 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
           of the fool: this also is vanity.

21:007:007 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth
           the heart.

21:007:008 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and
           the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

21:007:009 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in
           the bosom of fools.

21:007:010 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were
           better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning
           this.

21:007:011 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit
           to them that see the sun.

21:007:012 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
           excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them
           that have it.

21:007:013 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,
           which he hath made crooked?

21:007:014 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of
           adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the
           other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

21:007:015 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a
           just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a
           wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

21:007:016 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise:
           why shouldest thou destroy thyself?

21:007:017 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why
           shouldest thou die before thy time?

21:007:018 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
           from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God
           shall come forth of them all.

21:007:019 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which
           are in the city.

21:007:020 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
           sinneth not.

21:007:021 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou
           hear thy servant curse thee:

21:007:022 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
           likewise hast cursed others.

21:007:023 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but
           it was far from me.

21:007:024 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it
           out?

21:007:025 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
           wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness
           of folly, even of foolishness and madness:

21:007:026 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is
           snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God
           shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

21:007:027 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by
           one, to find out the account:

21:007:028 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a
           thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not
           found.

21:007:029 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
           but they have sought out many inventions.

21:008:001 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of
           a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the
           boldness of his face shall be changed.

21:008:002 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in
           regard of the oath of God.

21:008:003 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil
           thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

21:008:004 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say
           unto him, What doest thou?

21:008:005 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
           wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

21:008:006 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore
           the misery of man is great upon him.

21:008:007 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him
           when it shall be?

21:008:008 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
           spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there
           is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver
           those that are given to it.

21:008:009 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
           that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man
           ruleth over another to his own hurt.

21:008:010 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the
           place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where
           they had so done: this is also vanity.

21:008:011 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
           speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
           in them to do evil.

21:008:012 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
           prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
           that fear God, which fear before him:

21:008:013 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
           prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth
           not before God.

21:008:014 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
           just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the
           wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth
           according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
           is vanity.

21:008:015 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
           under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for
           that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,
           which God giveth him under the sun.

21:008:016 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
           business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that
           neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

21:008:017 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out
           the work that is done under the sun: because though a man
           labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther;
           though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able
           to find it.

21:009:001 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all
           this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are
           in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by
           all that is before them.

21:009:002 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the
           righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean,
           and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
           sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that
           sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

21:009:003 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun,
           that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the
           sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart
           while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

21:009:004 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for
           a living dog is better than a dead lion.

21:009:005 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
           any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
           of them is forgotten.

21:009:006 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
           perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any
           thing that is done under the sun.

21:009:007 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
           merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

21:009:008 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
           ointment.

21:009:009 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of
           the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the
           sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in
           this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.

21:009:010 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
           there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
           the grave, whither thou goest.

21:009:011 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
           swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
           wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour
           to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

21:009:012 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
           taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the
           snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
           falleth suddenly upon them.

21:009:013 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed
           great unto me:

21:009:014 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came
           a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great
           bulwarks against it:

21:009:015 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his
           wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same
           poor man.

21:009:016 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
           poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

21:009:017 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of
           him that ruleth among fools.

21:009:018 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner
           destroyeth much good.

21:010:001 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
           a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in
           reputation for wisdom and honour.

21:010:002 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at
           his left.

21:010:003 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his
           wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a
           fool.

21:010:004 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
           place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

21:010:005 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
           which proceedeth from the ruler:

21:010:006 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

21:010:007 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as
           servants upon the earth.

21:010:008 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh
           an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

21:010:009 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
           cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

21:010:010 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must
           he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

21:010:011 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a
           babbler is no better.

21:010:012 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of
           a fool will swallow up himself.

21:010:013 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and
           the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

21:010:014 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
           and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

21:010:015 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because
           he knoweth not how to go to the city.

21:010:016 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
           eat in the morning!

21:010:017 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
           and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
           drunkenness!

21:010:018 By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through
           idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

21:010:019 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
           answereth all things.

21:010:020 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
           rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the
           voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

21:011:001 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after
           many days.

21:011:002 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest
           not what evil shall be upon the earth.

21:011:003 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the
           earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the
           north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

21:011:004 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that
           regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

21:011:005 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the
           bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so
           thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

21:011:006 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not
           thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either
           this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

21:011:007 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
           eyes to behold the sun:

21:011:008 But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let
           him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All
           that cometh is vanity.

21:011:009 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
           thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
           heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for
           all these things God will bring thee into judgment.

21:011:010 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from
           thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

21:012:001 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
           evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt
           say, I have no pleasure in them;

21:012:002 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
           darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:

21:012:003 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
           the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease
           because they are few, and those that look out of the windows
           be darkened,

21:012:004 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of
           the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
           bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;

21:012:005 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and
           fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish,
           and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:
           because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
           the streets:

21:012:006 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
           broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
           broken at the cistern.

21:012:007 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
           spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

21:012:008 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

21:012:009 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught
           the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,
           and set in order many proverbs.

21:012:010 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that
           which was written was upright, even words of truth.

21:012:011 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by
           the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

21:012:012 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
           books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the
           flesh.

21:012:013 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
           keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

21:012:014 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
           secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

Book 22        Song of Solomon

22:001:001 The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

22:001:002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is
           better than wine.

22:001:003 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
           ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

22:001:004 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into
           his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will
           remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.

22:001:005 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the
           tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

22:001:006 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath
           looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they
           made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard
           have I not kept.

22:001:007 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
           thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as
           one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

22:001:008 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth
           by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the
           shepherds' tents.

22:001:009 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
           Pharaoh's chariots.

22:001:010 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with
           chains of gold.

22:001:011 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

22:001:012 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth
           forth the smell thereof.

22:001:013 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all
           night betwixt my breasts.

22:001:014 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the
           vineyards of Engedi.

22:001:015 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
           hast doves' eyes.

22:001:016 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed
           is green.

22:001:017 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.

22:002:001 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

22:002:002 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

22:002:003 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
           beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great
           delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

22:002:004 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me
           was love.

22:002:005 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of
           love.

22:002:006 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth
           embrace me.

22:002:007 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
           the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
           love, till he please.

22:002:008 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the
           mountains, skipping upon the hills.

22:002:009 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth
           behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing
           himself through the lattice.

22:002:010 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair
           one, and come away.

22:002:011 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;

22:002:012 The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of
           birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
           land;

22:002:013 The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with
           the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair
           one, and come away.

22:002:014 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret
           places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear
           thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is
           comely.

22:002:015 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for
           our vines have tender grapes.

22:002:016 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

22:002:017 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my
           beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the
           mountains of Bether.

22:003:001 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought
           him, but I found him not.

22:003:002 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in
           the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought
           him, but I found him not.

22:003:003 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said,
           Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

22:003:004 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him
           whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go,
           until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the
           chamber of her that conceived me.

22:003:005 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
           the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
           love, till he please.

22:003:006 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of
           smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders
           of the merchant?

22:003:007 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are
           about it, of the valiant of Israel.

22:003:008 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his
           sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

22:003:009 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

22:003:010 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of
           gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being
           paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.

22:003:011 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with
           the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his
           espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

22:004:001 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
           hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of
           goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

22:004:002 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which
           came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and
           none is barren among them.

22:004:003 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is
           comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within
           thy locks.

22:004:004 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,
           whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty
           men.

22:004:005 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which
           feed among the lilies.

22:004:006 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me
           to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

22:004:007 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.

22:004:008 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon:
           look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
           from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

22:004:009 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast
           ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of
           thy neck.

22:004:010 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is
           thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all
           spices!

22:004:011 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk
           are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like
           the smell of Lebanon.

22:004:012 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a
           fountain sealed.

22:004:013 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant
           fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

22:004:014 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of
           frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

22:004:015 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams
           from Lebanon.

22:004:016 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my
           garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved
           come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

22:005:001 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have
           gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb
           with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O
           friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

22:005:002 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved
           that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my
           dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my
           locks with the drops of the night.

22:005:003 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed
           my feet; how shall I defile them?

22:005:004 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my
           bowels were moved for him.

22:005:005 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with
           myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the
           handles of the lock.

22:005:006 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
           and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but
           I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

22:005:007 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me,
           they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil
           from me.

22:005:008 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,
           that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.

22:005:009 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest
           among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved,
           that thou dost so charge us?
