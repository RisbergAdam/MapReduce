           flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.

18:002:006 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
           save his life.

18:002:007 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote
           Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

18:002:008 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he
           sat down among the ashes.

18:002:009 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
           integrity? curse God, and die.

18:002:010 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
           women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of
           God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job
           sin with his lips.

18:002:011 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
           come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz
           the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
           Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come
           to mourn with him and to comfort him.

18:002:012 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
           they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one
           his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.

18:002:013 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
           nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his
           grief was very great.

18:003:001 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

18:003:002 And Job spake, and said,

18:003:003 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which
           it was said, There is a man child conceived.

18:003:004 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
           neither let the light shine upon it.

18:003:005 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud
           dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

18:003:006 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
           joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the
           number of the months.

18:003:007 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come
           therein.

18:003:008 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise
           up their mourning.

18:003:009 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
           light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the
           day:

18:003:010 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid
           sorrow from mine eyes.

18:003:011 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
           when I came out of the belly?

18:003:012 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should
           suck?

18:003:013 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have
           slept: then had I been at rest,

18:003:014 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate
           places for themselves;

18:003:015 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with
           silver:

18:003:016 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants
           which never saw light.

18:003:017 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be
           at rest.

18:003:018 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of
           the oppressor.

18:003:019 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from
           his master.

18:003:020 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life
           unto the bitter in soul;

18:003:021 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more
           than for hid treasures;

18:003:022 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find
           the grave?

18:003:023 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God
           hath hedged in?

18:003:024 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
           out like the waters.

18:003:025 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that
           which I was afraid of is come unto me.

18:003:026 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;
           yet trouble came.

18:004:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

18:004:002 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but
           who can withhold himself from speaking?

18:004:003 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened
           the weak hands.

18:004:004 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
           strengthened the feeble knees.

18:004:005 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth
           thee, and thou art troubled.

18:004:006 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
           uprightness of thy ways?

18:004:007 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or
           where were the righteous cut off?

18:004:008 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow
           wickedness, reap the same.

18:004:009 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his
           nostrils are they consumed.

18:004:010 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and
           the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

18:004:011 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's
           whelps are scattered abroad.

18:004:012 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received
           a little thereof.

18:004:013 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
           falleth on men,

18:004:014 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to
           shake.

18:004:015 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh
           stood up:

18:004:016 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an
           image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a
           voice, saying,

18:004:017 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more
           pure than his maker?

18:004:018 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he
           charged with folly:

18:004:019 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose
           foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?

18:004:020 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for
           ever without any regarding it.

18:004:021 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,
           even without wisdom.

18:005:001 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which
           of the saints wilt thou turn?

18:005:002 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly
           one.

18:005:003 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
           habitation.

18:005:004 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
           gate, neither is there any to deliver them.

18:005:005 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of
           the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.

18:005:006 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth
           trouble spring out of the ground;

18:005:007 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

18:005:008 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:

18:005:009 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things
           without number:

18:005:010 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the
           fields:

18:005:011 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn
           may be exalted to safety.

18:005:012 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their
           hands cannot perform their enterprise.

18:005:013 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
           the froward is carried headlong.

18:005:014 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the
           noonday as in the night.

18:005:015 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and
           from the hand of the mighty.

18:005:016 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

18:005:017 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore
           despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:

18:005:018 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands
           make whole.

18:005:019 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there
           shall no evil touch thee.

18:005:020 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the
           power of the sword.

18:005:021 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither
           shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

18:005:022 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou
           be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

18:005:023 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and
           the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

18:005:024 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and
           thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.

18:005:025 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
           offspring as the grass of the earth.

18:005:026 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
           corn cometh in in his season.

18:005:027 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou
           it for thy good.

18:006:001 But Job answered and said,

18:006:002 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid
           in the balances together!

18:006:003 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
           therefore my words are swallowed up.

18:006:004 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison
           whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set
           themselves in array against me.

18:006:005 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox
           over his fodder?

18:006:006 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there
           any taste in the white of an egg?

18:006:007 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful
           meat.

18:006:008 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me
           the thing that I long for!

18:006:009 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let
           loose his hand, and cut me off!

18:006:010 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in
           sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words
           of the Holy One.

18:006:011 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,
           that I should prolong my life?

18:006:012 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of
           brass?

18:006:013 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

18:006:014 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his
           friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

18:006:015 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the
           stream of brooks they pass away;

18:006:016 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow
           is hid:

18:006:017 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are
           consumed out of their place.

18:006:018 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing,
           and perish.

18:006:019 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for
           them.

18:006:020 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came
           thither, and were ashamed.

18:006:021 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are
           afraid.

18:006:022 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
           substance?

18:006:023 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the
           hand of the mighty?

18:006:024 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to
           understand wherein I have erred.

18:006:025 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing
           reprove?

18:006:026 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that
           is desperate, which are as wind?

18:006:027 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your
           friend.

18:006:028 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto
           you if I lie.

18:006:029 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again,
           my righteousness is in it.

18:006:030 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern
           perverse things?

18:007:001 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his
           days also like the days of an hireling?

18:007:002 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling
           looketh for the reward of his work:

18:007:003 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights
           are appointed to me.

18:007:004 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be
           gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of
           the day.

18:007:005 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
           broken, and become loathsome.

18:007:006 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent
           without hope.

18:007:007 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see
           good.

18:007:008 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine
           eyes are upon me, and I am not.

18:007:009 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth
           down to the grave shall come up no more.

18:007:010 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
           know him any more.

18:007:011 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
           anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my
           soul.

18:007:012 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

18:007:013 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my
           complaints;

18:007:014 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through
           visions:

18:007:015 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my
           life.

18:007:016 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days
           are vanity.

18:007:017 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou
           shouldest set thine heart upon him?

18:007:018 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him
           every moment?

18:007:019 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I
           swallow down my spittle?

18:007:020 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of
           men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am
           a burden to myself?

18:007:021 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away
           my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt
           seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.

18:008:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

18:008:002 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the
           words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?

18:008:003 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert
           justice?

18:008:004 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them
           away for their transgression;

18:008:005 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy
           supplication to the Almighty;

18:008:006 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for
           thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

18:008:007 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should
           greatly increase.

18:008:008 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare
           thyself to the search of their fathers:

18:008:009 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our
           days upon earth are a shadow:)

18:008:010 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out
           of their heart?

18:008:011 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without
           water?

18:008:012 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it
           withereth before any other herb.

18:008:013 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's
           hope shall perish:

18:008:014 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a
           spider's web.

18:008:015 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall
           hold it fast, but it shall not endure.

18:008:016 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in
           his garden.

18:008:017 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of
           stones.

18:008:018 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him,
           saying, I have not seen thee.

18:008:019 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall
           others grow.

18:008:020 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he
           help the evil doers:

18:008:021 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with
           rejoicing.

18:008:022 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the
           dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.

18:009:001 Then Job answered and said,

18:009:002 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with
           God?

18:009:003 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a
           thousand.

18:009:004 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
           himself against him, and hath prospered?

18:009:005 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which
           overturneth them in his anger.

18:009:006 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars
           thereof tremble.

18:009:007 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up
           the stars.

18:009:008 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the
           waves of the sea.

18:009:009 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers
           of the south.

18:009:010 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders
           without number.

18:009:011 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but
           I perceive him not.

18:009:012 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto
           him, What doest thou?

18:009:013 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop
           under him.

18:009:014 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to
           reason with him?

18:009:015 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I
           would make supplication to my judge.

18:009:016 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not
           believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.

18:009:017 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
           without cause.

18:009:018 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
           bitterness.

18:009:019 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment,
           who shall set me a time to plead?

18:009:020 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I
           say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

18:009:021 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would
           despise my life.

18:009:022 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the
           perfect and the wicked.

18:009:023 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of
           the innocent.

18:009:024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth
           the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?

18:009:025 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see
           no good.

18:009:026 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that
           hasteth to the prey.

18:009:027 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my
           heaviness, and comfort myself:

18:009:028 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold
           me innocent.

18:009:029 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

18:009:030 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so
           clean;

18:009:031 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes
           shall abhor me.

18:009:032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we
           should come together in judgment.

18:009:033 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his
           hand upon us both.

18:009:034 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear
           terrify me:

18:009:035 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with
           me.

18:010:001 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
           myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

18:010:002 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
           contendest with me.

18:010:003 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
           shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the
           counsel of the wicked?

18:010:004 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

18:010:005 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,

18:010:006 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after
           my sin?

18:010:007 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can
           deliver out of thine hand.

18:010:008 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round
           about; yet thou dost destroy me.

18:010:009 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;
           and wilt thou bring me into dust again?

18:010:010 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like
           cheese?

18:010:011 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me
           with bones and sinews.

18:010:012 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
           preserved my spirit.

18:010:013 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that
           this is with thee.

18:010:014 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me
           from mine iniquity.

18:010:015 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I
           not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see
           thou mine affliction;

18:010:016 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again
           thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

18:010:017 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
           indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.

18:010:018 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh
           that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

18:010:019 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have
           been carried from the womb to the grave.

18:010:020 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
           take comfort a little,

18:010:021 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of
           darkness and the shadow of death;

18:010:022 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of
           death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.

18:011:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

18:011:002 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a
           man full of talk be justified?

18:011:003 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou
           mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

18:011:004 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in
           thine eyes.

18:011:005 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

18:011:006 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they
           are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth
           of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.

18:011:007 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
           Almighty unto perfection?

18:011:008 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell;
           what canst thou know?

18:011:009 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than
           the sea.

18:011:010 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can
           hinder him?

18:011:011 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not
           then consider it?

18:011:012 For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild
           ass's colt.

18:011:013 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands
           toward him;

18:011:014 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not
           wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

18:011:015 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou
           shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

18:011:016 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as
           waters that pass away:

18:011:017 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt
           shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

18:011:018 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou
           shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

18:011:019 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
           yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

18:011:020 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not
           escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.

18:012:001 And Job answered and said,

18:012:002 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

18:012:003 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to
           you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

18:012:004 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and
           he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.

18:012:005 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised
           in the thought of him that is at ease.

18:012:006 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God
           are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.

18:012:007 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the
           fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

18:012:008 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes
           of the sea shall declare unto thee.

18:012:009 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath
           wrought this?

18:012:010 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the
           breath of all mankind.

18:012:011 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

18:012:012 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days
           understanding.

18:012:013 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
           understanding.

18:012:014 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he
           shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

18:012:015 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he
           sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

18:012:016 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
           are his.

18:012:017 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges
           fools.

18:012:018 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a
           girdle.

18:012:019 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

18:012:020 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
           understanding of the aged.

18:012:021 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength
           of the mighty.

18:012:022 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out
           to light the shadow of death.

18:012:023 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth
           the nations, and straiteneth them again.

18:012:024 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
           earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there
           is no way.

18:012:025 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to
           stagger like a drunken man.

18:013:001 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and
           understood it.

18:013:002 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto
           you.

18:013:003 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason
           with God.

18:013:004 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.

18:013:005 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be
           your wisdom.

18:013:006 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my
           lips.

18:013:007 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

18:013:008 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

18:013:009 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man
           mocketh another, do ye so mock him?

18:013:010 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

18:013:011 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
           upon you?

18:013:012 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies
           of clay.

18:013:013 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come
           on me what will.

18:013:014 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in
           mine hand?

18:013:015 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will
           maintain mine own ways before him.

18:013:016 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
           before him.

18:013:017 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

18:013:018 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
           justified.

18:013:019 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my
           tongue, I shall give up the ghost.

18:013:020 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself
           from thee.

18:013:021 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
           afraid.

18:013:022 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer
           thou me.

18:013:023 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
           transgression and my sin.

18:013:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine
           enemy?

18:013:025 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue
           the dry stubble?

18:013:026 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to
           possess the iniquities of my youth.

18:013:027 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly
           unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my
           feet.

18:013:028 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is
           moth eaten.

18:014:001 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of
           trouble.

18:014:002 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also
           as a shadow, and continueth not.

18:014:003 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest
           me into judgment with thee?

18:014:004 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

18:014:005 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are
           with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

18:014:006 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as
           an hireling, his day.

18:014:007 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
           sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not
           cease.

18:014:008 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
           thereof die in the ground;

18:014:009 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
           boughs like a plant.

18:014:010 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
           and where is he?

18:014:011 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and
           drieth up:

18:014:012 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no
           more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

18:014:013 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
           keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest
           appoint me a set time, and remember me!

18:014:014 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my
           appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

18:014:015 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a
           desire to the work of thine hands.

18:014:016 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
           sin?

18:014:017 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up
           mine iniquity.

18:014:018 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the
           rock is removed out of his place.

18:014:019 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which
           grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the
           hope of man.

18:014:020 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou
           changest his countenance, and sendest him away.

18:014:021 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are
           brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.

18:014:022 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within
           him shall mourn.

18:015:001 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,

18:015:002 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly
           with the east wind?

18:015:003 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches
           wherewith he can do no good?

18:015:004 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.

18:015:005 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the
           tongue of the crafty.

18:015:006 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own
           lips testify against thee.

18:015:007 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before
           the hills?

18:015:008 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain
           wisdom to thyself?

18:015:009 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou,
           which is not in us?

18:015:010 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder
           than thy father.

18:015:011 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any
           secret thing with thee?

18:015:012 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes
           wink at,

18:015:013 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such
           words go out of thy mouth?

18:015:014 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of
           a woman, that he should be righteous?

18:015:015 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens
           are not clean in his sight.

18:015:016 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh
           iniquity like water?

18:015:017 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will
           declare;

18:015:018 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid
           it:

18:015:019 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed
           among them.

18:015:020 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the
           number of years is hidden to the oppressor.

18:015:021 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
           shall come upon him.

18:015:022 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he
           is waited for of the sword.

18:015:023 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth
           that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

18:015:024 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
           against him, as a king ready to the battle.

18:015:025 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth
           himself against the Almighty.

18:015:026 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses
           of his bucklers:

18:015:027 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh
           collops of fat on his flanks.

18:015:028 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man
           inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.

18:015:029 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
           neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the
           earth.

18:015:030 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up
           his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.

18:015:031 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall
           be his recompence.

18:015:032 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall
           not be green.

18:015:033 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall
           cast off his flower as the olive.

18:015:034 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire
           shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.

18:015:035 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their
           belly prepareth deceit.

18:016:001 Then Job answered and said,

18:016:002 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye
           all.

18:016:003 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that
           thou answerest?

18:016:004 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's
           stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head
           at you.

18:016:005 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my
           lips should asswage your grief.

18:016:006 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I
           forbear, what am I eased?

18:016:007 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my
           company.

18:016:008 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness
           against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to
           my face.

18:016:009 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
           with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

18:016:010 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me
           upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves
           together against me.

18:016:011 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into
           the hands of the wicked.

18:016:012 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also
           taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up
           for his mark.

18:016:013 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
           asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the
           ground.

18:016:014 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me
           like a giant.

18:016:015 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in
           the dust.

18:016:016 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow
           of death;

18:016:017 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.

18:016:018 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no
           place.

18:016:019 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on
           high.

18:016:020 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

18:016:021 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth
           for his neighbour!

18:016:022 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I
           shall not return.

18:017:001 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are
           ready for me.

18:017:002 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue
           in their provocation?

18:017:003 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that
           will strike hands with me?

18:017:004 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore
           shalt thou not exalt them.

18:017:005 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
           children shall fail.

18:017:006 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I
           was as a tabret.

18:017:007 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members
           are as a shadow.

18:017:008 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall
           stir up himself against the hypocrite.

18:017:009 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath
           clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.

18:017:010 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot
           find one wise man among you.

18:017:011 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the
           thoughts of my heart.

18:017:012 They change the night into day: the light is short because of
           darkness.

18:017:013 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the
           darkness.

18:017:014 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm,
           Thou art my mother, and my sister.

18:017:015 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?

18:017:016 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest
           together is in the dust.

18:018:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

18:018:002 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and
           afterwards we will speak.

18:018:003 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your
           sight?

18:018:004 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken
           for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

18:018:005 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark
           of his fire shall not shine.

18:018:006 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle
           shall be put out with him.

18:018:007 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own
           counsel shall cast him down.

18:018:008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon
           a snare.

18:018:009 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall
           prevail against him.

18:018:010 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
           the way.

18:018:011 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive
           him to his feet.

18:018:012 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be
           ready at his side.

18:018:013 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn
           of death shall devour his strength.

18:018:014 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
           shall bring him to the king of terrors.

18:018:015 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
           brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

18:018:016 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his
           branch be cut off.

18:018:017 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have
           no name in the street.

18:018:018 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
           the world.

18:018:019 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any
           remaining in his dwellings.

18:018:020 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they
           that went before were affrighted.

18:018:021 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the
           place of him that knoweth not God.

18:019:001 Then Job answered and said,

18:019:002 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with
           words?

18:019:003 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that
           ye make yourselves strange to me.

18:019:004 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
           myself.

18:019:005 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
           against me my reproach:

18:019:006 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me
           with his net.

18:019:007 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud,
           but there is no judgment.

18:019:008 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
           darkness in my paths.

18:019:009 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my
           head.

18:019:010 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine
           hope hath he removed like a tree.

18:019:011 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me
           unto him as one of his enemies.

18:019:012 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,
           and encamp round about my tabernacle.

18:019:013 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
           verily estranged from me.

18:019:014 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have
           forgotten me.

18:019:015 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
           stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

18:019:016 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
           with my mouth.

18:019:017 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
           children's sake of mine own body.

18:019:018 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake
           against me.

18:019:019 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are
           turned against me.

18:019:020 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped
           with the skin of my teeth.

18:019:021 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
           hand of God hath touched me.

18:019:022 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
           flesh?

18:019:023 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed
           in a book!

18:019:024 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock
           for ever!

18:019:025 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at
           the latter day upon the earth:

18:019:026 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
           flesh shall I see God:

18:019:027 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and
           not another; though my reins be consumed within me.

18:019:028 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of
           the matter is found in me?

18:019:029 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments
           of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.

18:020:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

18:020:002 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I
           make haste.

18:020:003 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
           understanding causeth me to answer.

18:020:004 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,

18:020:005 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
           hypocrite but for a moment?

18:020:006 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head
           reach unto the clouds;

18:020:007 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which
           have seen him shall say, Where is he?

18:020:008 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he
           shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

18:020:009 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither
           shall his place any more behold him.

18:020:010 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands
           shall restore their goods.

18:020:011 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie
           down with him in the dust.

18:020:012 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it
           under his tongue;

18:020:013 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still
           within his mouth:

18:020:014 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps
           within him.

18:020:015 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up
           again: God shall cast them out of his belly.

18:020:016 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall
           slay him.

18:020:017 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey
           and butter.

18:020:018 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not
           swallow it down: according to his substance shall the
           restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.

18:020:019 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because
           he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;

18:020:020 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not
           save of that which he desired.

18:020:021 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man
           look for his goods.

18:020:022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
           every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.

18:020:023 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of
           his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is
           eating.

18:020:024 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall
           strike him through.

18:020:025 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering
           sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.

18:020:026 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not
           blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left
           in his tabernacle.

18:020:027 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise
           up against him.

18:020:028 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall
           flow away in the day of his wrath.

18:020:029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
           appointed unto him by God.

18:021:001 But Job answered and said,

18:021:002 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

18:021:003 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock
           on.

18:021:004 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why
           should not my spirit be troubled?

18:021:005 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.

18:021:006 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on
           my flesh.

18:021:007 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in
           power?

18:021:008 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their
           offspring before their eyes.

18:021:009 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God
           upon them.

18:021:010 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and
           casteth not her calf.

18:021:011 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their
           children dance.

18:021:012 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of
           the organ.

18:021:013 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to
           the grave.

18:021:014 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
           the knowledge of thy ways.

18:021:015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what
           profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

18:021:016 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked
           is far from me.

18:021:017 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft
           cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows
           in his anger.

18:021:018 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the
           storm carrieth away.

18:021:019 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,
           and he shall know it.

18:021:020 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the
           wrath of the Almighty.

18:021:021 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the
           number of his months is cut off in the midst?

18:021:022 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that
           are high.

18:021:023 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and
           quiet.

18:021:024 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
           marrow.

18:021:025 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never
           eateth with pleasure.

18:021:026 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall
           cover them.

18:021:027 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye
           wrongfully imagine against me.

18:021:028 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are
           the dwelling places of the wicked?

18:021:029 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know
           their tokens,

18:021:030 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they
           shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.

18:021:031 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him
           what he hath done?

18:021:032 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the
           tomb.

18:021:033 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man
           shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.

18:021:034 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there
           remaineth falsehood?

18:022:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

18:022:002 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
           profitable unto himself?

18:022:003 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?
           or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?

18:022:004 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee
           into judgment?

18:022:005 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?

18:022:006 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and
           stripped the naked of their clothing.

18:022:007 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast
           withholden bread from the hungry.

18:022:008 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the
           honourable man dwelt in it.

18:022:009 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the
           fatherless have been broken.

18:022:010 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear
           troubleth thee;

18:022:011 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters
           cover thee.

18:022:012 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of
           the stars, how high they are!

18:022:013 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the
           dark cloud?

18:022:014 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he
           walketh in the circuit of heaven.

18:022:015 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?

18:022:016 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was
           overflown with a flood:

18:022:017 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty
           do for them?

18:022:018 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel
           of the wicked is far from me.

18:022:019 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh
           them to scorn.

18:022:020 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them
           the fire consumeth.

18:022:021 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good
           shall come unto thee.

18:022:022 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his
           words in thine heart.

18:022:023 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou
           shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

18:022:024 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as
           the stones of the brooks.

18:022:025 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have
           plenty of silver.

18:022:026 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and
           shalt lift up thy face unto God.

18:022:027 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
           and thou shalt pay thy vows.

18:022:028 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established
           unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.

18:022:029 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting
           up; and he shall save the humble person.

18:022:030 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is
           delivered by the pureness of thine hands.

18:023:001 Then Job answered and said,

18:023:002 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than
           my groaning.

18:023:003 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even
           to his seat!

18:023:004 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with
           arguments.

18:023:005 I would know the words which he would answer me, and
           understand what he would say unto me.

18:023:006 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he
           would put strength in me.

18:023:007 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
           delivered for ever from my judge.

18:023:008 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I
           cannot perceive him:

18:023:009 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
           he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:

18:023:010 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I
           shall come forth as gold.

18:023:011 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not
           declined.

18:023:012 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I
           have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary
           food.

18:023:013 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul
           desireth, even that he doeth.

18:023:014 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many
           such things are with him.

18:023:015 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
           afraid of him.

18:023:016 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

18:023:017 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he
           covered the darkness from my face.

18:024:001 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they
           that know him not see his days?

18:024:002 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,
           and feed thereof.

18:024:003 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the
           widow's ox for a pledge.

18:024:004 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
           themselves together.

18:024:005 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their
           work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food
           for them and for their children.

18:024:006 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the
           vintage of the wicked.

18:024:007 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have
           no covering in the cold.

18:024:008 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace
           the rock for want of a shelter.

18:024:009 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge
           of the poor.

18:024:010 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take
           away the sheaf from the hungry;

18:024:011 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their
           winepresses, and suffer thirst.

18:024:012 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
           crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.

18:024:013 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
           the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

18:024:014 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
           and in the night is as a thief.

18:024:015 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
           saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.

18:024:016 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for
           themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.

18:024:017 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one
           know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.

18:024:018 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the
           earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

18:024:019 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave
           those which have sinned.

18:024:020 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
           he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken
           as a tree.

18:024:021 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
           good to the widow.

18:024:022 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and
           no man is sure of life.

18:024:023 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;
           yet his eyes are upon their ways.

18:024:024 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought
           low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off
           as the tops of the ears of corn.

18:024:025 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my
           speech nothing worth?

18:025:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

18:025:002 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high
           places.

18:025:003 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his
           light arise?

18:025:004 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean
           that is born of a woman?

18:025:005 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars
           are not pure in his sight.

18:025:006 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which
           is a worm?

18:026:001 But Job answered and said,

18:026:002 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest
           thou the arm that hath no strength?

18:026:003 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast
           thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

18:026:004 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from
           thee?

18:026:005 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the
           inhabitants thereof.

18:026:006 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

18:026:007 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth
           the earth upon nothing.

18:026:008 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is
           not rent under them.

18:026:009 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his
           cloud upon it.

18:026:010 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and
           night come to an end.

18:026:011 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his
           reproof.

18:026:012 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding
           he smiteth through the proud.

18:026:013 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath
           formed the crooked serpent.

18:026:014 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
           heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

18:027:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

18:027:002 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the
           Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;

18:027:003 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in
           my nostrils;

18:027:004 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter
           deceit.

18:027:005 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not
           remove mine integrity from me.

18:027:006 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart
           shall not reproach me so long as I live.

18:027:007 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against
           me as the unrighteous.

18:027:008 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
           when God taketh away his soul?

18:027:009 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?

18:027:010 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call
           upon God?

18:027:011 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the
           Almighty will I not conceal.

18:027:012 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
           altogether vain?

18:027:013 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage
           of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.

18:027:014 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his
           offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

18:027:015 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his
           widows shall not weep.

18:027:016 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as
           the clay;

18:027:017 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the
           innocent shall divide the silver.

18:027:018 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the
           keeper maketh.

18:027:019 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he
           openeth his eyes, and he is not.

18:027:020 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him
           away in the night.

18:027:021 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a
           storm hurleth him out of his place.

18:027:022 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee
           out of his hand.

18:027:023 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of
           his place.

18:028:001 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold
           where they fine it.

18:028:002 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the
           stone.

18:028:003 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all
           perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

18:028:004 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters
           forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away
           from men.

18:028:005 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is
           turned up as it were fire.

18:028:006 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust
           of gold.

18:028:007 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's
           eye hath not seen:

18:028:008 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion
           passed by it.

18:028:009 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
           mountains by the roots.

18:028:010 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every
           precious thing.

18:028:011 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is
           hid bringeth he forth to light.

18:028:012 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of
           understanding?

18:028:013 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the
           land of the living.

18:028:014 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not
           with me.

18:028:015 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
           for the price thereof.

18:028:016 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
           onyx, or the sapphire.

18:028:017 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of
           it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.

18:028:018 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price
           of wisdom is above rubies.

18:028:019 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be
           valued with pure gold.

18:028:020 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
           understanding?

18:028:021 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close
           from the fowls of the air.

18:028:022 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with
           our ears.

18:028:023 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place
           thereof.

18:028:024 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the
           whole heaven;

18:028:025 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters
           by measure.

18:028:026 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the
           lightning of the thunder:

18:028:027 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and
           searched it out.

18:028:028 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is
           wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

18:029:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

18:029:002 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God
           preserved me;

18:029:003 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I
           walked through darkness;

18:029:004 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was
           upon my tabernacle;

18:029:005 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about
           me;

18:029:006 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out
           rivers of oil;

18:029:007 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared
           my seat in the street!

18:029:008 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,
           and stood up.

18:029:009 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their
           mouth.

18:029:010 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the
           roof of their mouth.

18:029:011 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye
           saw me, it gave witness to me:

18:029:012 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,
           and him that had none to help him.

18:029:013 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and
           I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

18:029:014 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as
           a robe and a diadem.

18:029:015 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.

18:029:016 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I
           searched out.

18:029:017 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out
           of his teeth.

18:029:018 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my
           days as the sand.

18:029:019 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all
           night upon my branch.

18:029:020 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

18:029:021 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
           counsel.

18:029:022 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped
           upon them.

18:029:023 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their
           mouth wide as for the latter rain.

18:029:024 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of
           my countenance they cast not down.

18:029:025 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in
           the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.

18:030:001 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
           whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs
           of my flock.

18:030:002 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in
           whom old age was perished?

18:030:003 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the
           wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

18:030:004 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their
           meat.

18:030:005 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them
           as after a thief;)

18:030:006 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth,
           and in the rocks.

18:030:007 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were
           gathered together.

18:030:008 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they
           were viler than the earth.

18:030:009 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

18:030:010 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in
           my face.

18:030:011 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have
           also let loose the bridle before me.

18:030:012 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
           they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

18:030:013 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
           helper.

18:030:014 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the
           desolation they rolled themselves upon me.

18:030:015 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind:
           and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

18:030:016 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction
           have taken hold upon me.

18:030:017 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews
           take no rest.

18:030:018 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it
           bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

18:030:019 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
           ashes.

18:030:020 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and
           thou regardest me not.

18:030:021 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou
           opposest thyself against me.

18:030:022 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon
           it, and dissolvest my substance.

18:030:023 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house
           appointed for all living.

18:030:024 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though
           they cry in his destruction.

18:030:025 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul
           grieved for the poor?

18:030:026 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I
           waited for light, there came darkness.

18:030:027 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
           prevented me.

18:030:028 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in
           the congregation.

18:030:029 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

18:030:030 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

18:030:031 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the
           voice of them that weep.

18:031:001 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon
           a maid?

18:031:002 For what portion of God is there from above? and what
           inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

18:031:003 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to
           the workers of iniquity?

18:031:004 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

18:031:005 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to
           deceit;

18:031:006 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine
           integrity.

18:031:007 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked
           after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;

18:031:008 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be
           rooted out.

18:031:009 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
           wait at my neighbour's door;

18:031:010 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down
           upon her.

18:031:011 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
           punished by the judges.

18:031:012 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root
           out all mine increase.

18:031:013 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
           maidservant, when they contended with me;

18:031:014 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth,
           what shall I answer him?

18:031:015 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
           fashion us in the womb?

18:031:016 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused
           the eyes of the widow to fail;

18:031:017 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath
           not eaten thereof;

18:031:018 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a
           father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)

18:031:019 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor
           without covering;

18:031:020 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed
           with the fleece of my sheep;

18:031:021 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw
           my help in the gate:

18:031:022 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be
           broken from the bone.

18:031:023 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
           his highness I could not endure.

18:031:024 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,
           Thou art my confidence;

18:031:025 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine
           hand had gotten much;

18:031:026 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
           brightness;

18:031:027 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath
           kissed my hand:

18:031:028 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I
           should have denied the God that is above.

18:031:029 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or
           lifted up myself when evil found him:

18:031:030 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to
           his soul.

18:031:031 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
           flesh! we cannot be satisfied.

18:031:032 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my
           doors to the traveller.

18:031:033 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine
           iniquity in my bosom:

18:031:034 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families
           terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?

18:031:035 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the
           Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written
           a book.

18:031:036 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a
           crown to me.

18:031:037 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
           would I go near unto him.

18:031:038 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise
           thereof complain;

18:031:039 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have
           caused the owners thereof to lose their life:

18:031:040 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of
           barley. The words of Job are ended.

18:032:001 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was
           righteous in his own eyes.

18:032:002 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
           Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath
           kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

18:032:003 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because
           they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

18:032:004 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were
           elder than he.

18:032:005 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
           three men, then his wrath was kindled.

18:032:006 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I
           am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and
           durst not shew you mine opinion.

18:032:007 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach
           wisdom.

18:032:008 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
           Almighty giveth them understanding.

18:032:009 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
           judgment.

18:032:010 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine
           opinion.

18:032:011 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,
           whilst ye searched out what to say.

18:032:012 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you
           that convinced Job, or that answered his words:

18:032:013 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth
           him down, not man.

18:032:014 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I
           answer him with your speeches.

18:032:015 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off
           speaking.

18:032:016 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
           answered no more;)

18:032:017 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine
           opinion.

18:032:018 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

18:032:019 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to
           burst like new bottles.

18:032:020 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
           answer.

18:032:021 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let
           me give flattering titles unto man.

18:032:022 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker
           would soon take me away.

18:033:001 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to
           all my words.

18:033:002 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in
           my mouth.

18:033:003 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips
           shall utter knowledge clearly.

18:033:004 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
           hath given me life.

18:033:005 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me,
           stand up.

18:033:006 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am
           formed out of the clay.

18:033:007 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
           hand be heavy upon thee.

18:033:008 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the
           voice of thy words, saying,

18:033:009 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is
           there iniquity in me.

18:033:010 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for
           his enemy,

18:033:011 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.

18:033:012 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that
           God is greater than man.

18:033:013 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of
           any of his matters.

18:033:014 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.

18:033:015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
           upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;

18:033:016 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their
           instruction,

18:033:017 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from
           man.

18:033:018 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
           perishing by the sword.

18:033:019 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
           of his bones with strong pain:

18:033:020 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

18:033:021 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his
           bones that were not seen stick out.

18:033:022 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
           destroyers.

18:033:023 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
           thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:

18:033:024 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from
           going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.

18:033:025 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to
           the days of his youth:

18:033:026 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:
           and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto
           man his righteousness.

18:033:027 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and
           perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;

18:033:028 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life
           shall see the light.

18:033:029 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,

18:033:030 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with
           the light of the living.

18:033:031 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will
           speak.

18:033:032 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire
           to justify thee.

18:033:033 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach
           thee wisdom.

18:034:001 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,

18:034:002 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that
           have knowledge.

18:034:003 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.

18:034:004 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what
           is good.

18:034:005 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
           judgment.

18:034:006 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
           transgression.

18:034:007 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?

18:034:008 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and
           walketh with wicked men.

18:034:009 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should
           delight himself with God.

18:034:010 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it
           from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty,
           that he should commit iniquity.

18:034:011 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause
           every man to find according to his ways.

18:034:012 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the
           Almighty pervert judgment.

18:034:013 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath
           disposed the whole world?

18:034:014 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his
           spirit and his breath;

18:034:015 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto
           dust.

18:034:016 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the
           voice of my words.

18:034:017 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
           him that is most just?

18:034:018 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes,
           Ye are ungodly?

18:034:019 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of
           princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they
           all are the work of his hands.

18:034:020 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled
           at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away
           without hand.

18:034:021 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
           goings.

18:034:022 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers
           of iniquity may hide themselves.

18:034:023 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should
           enter into judgment with God.

18:034:024 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set
           others in their stead.

18:034:025 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in
           the night, so that they are destroyed.

18:034:026 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;

18:034:027 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any
           of his ways:

18:034:028 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and
           he heareth the cry of the afflicted.

18:034:029 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when
           he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be
           done against a nation, or against a man only:

18:034:030 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.

18:034:031 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
           chastisement, I will not offend any more:

18:034:032 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I
           will do no more.

18:034:033 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
           whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:
           therefore speak what thou knowest.

18:034:034 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken
           unto me.

18:034:035 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
           wisdom.

18:034:036 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
           answers for wicked men.

18:034:037 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands
           among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

18:035:001 Elihu spake moreover, and said,

18:035:002 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My
           righteousness is more than God's?

18:035:003 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and,
           What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?

18:035:004 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

18:035:005 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which
           are higher than thou.

18:035:006 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy
           transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

18:035:007 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth
           he of thine hand?

18:035:008 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy
           righteousness may profit the son of man.

18:035:009 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the
           oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the
           mighty.

18:035:010 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
           night;

18:035:011 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh
           us wiser than the fowls of heaven?

18:035:012 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride
           of evil men.

18:035:013 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
           regard it.

18:035:014 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is
           before him; therefore trust thou in him.

18:035:015 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;
           yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:

18:035:016 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth
           words without knowledge.

18:036:001 Elihu also proceeded, and said,

18:036:002 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to
           speak on God's behalf.

18:036:003 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
           righteousness to my Maker.

18:036:004 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in
           knowledge is with thee.

18:036:005 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in
           strength and wisdom.

18:036:006 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to
           the poor.

18:036:007 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings
           are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever,
           and they are exalted.

18:036:008 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
           affliction;

18:036:009 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that
           they have exceeded.

18:036:010 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that
           they return from iniquity.

18:036:011 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in
           prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

18:036:012 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they
           shall die without knowledge.

18:036:013 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when
           he bindeth them.

18:036:014 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.

18:036:015 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their
           ears in oppression.

18:036:016 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
           broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which
           should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.

18:036:017 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment
           and justice take hold on thee.

18:036:018 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
           stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

18:036:019 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
           strength.

18:036:020 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

18:036:021 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen
           rather than affliction.

18:036:022 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?

18:036:023 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast
           wrought iniquity?

18:036:024 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

18:036:025 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.

18:036:026 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the
           number of his years be searched out.

18:036:027 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
           according to the vapour thereof:

18:036:028 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.

18:036:029 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the
           noise of his tabernacle?

18:036:030 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the
           bottom of the sea.

18:036:031 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in
           abundance.

18:036:032 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
           shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.

18:036:033 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
           concerning the vapour.

18:037:001 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his
           place.

18:037:002 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that
           goeth out of his mouth.

18:037:003 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto
           the ends of the earth.

18:037:004 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
           excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.

18:037:005 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth
           he, which we cannot comprehend.

18:037:006 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to
           the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.

18:037:007 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his
           work.

18:037:008 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.

18:037:009 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the
           north.

18:037:010 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the
           waters is straitened.

18:037:011 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth
           his bright cloud:

18:037:012 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do
           whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in
           the earth.

18:037:013 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his
           land, or for mercy.

18:037:014 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the
           wondrous works of God.

18:037:015 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of
           his cloud to shine?

18:037:016 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous
           works of him which is perfect in knowledge?

18:037:017 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
           south wind?

18:037:018 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as
           a molten looking glass?

18:037:019 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our
           speech by reason of darkness.

18:037:020 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he
           shall be swallowed up.

18:037:021 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds:
           but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

18:037:022 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible
           majesty.

18:037:023 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
           in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will
           not afflict.

18:037:024 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise
           of heart.

18:038:001 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

18:038:002 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

18:038:003 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee,
           and answer thou me.

18:038:004 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
           declare, if thou hast understanding.

18:038:005 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who
           hath stretched the line upon it?

18:038:006 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid
           the corner stone thereof;

18:038:007 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
           shouted for joy?

18:038:008 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if
           it had issued out of the womb?

18:038:009 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness
           a swaddlingband for it,

18:038:010 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,

18:038:011 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here
           shall thy proud waves be stayed?

18:038:012 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the
           dayspring to know his place;

18:038:013 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the
           wicked might be shaken out of it?

18:038:014 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.

18:038:015 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high
           arm shall be broken.

18:038:016 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou
           walked in the search of the depth?

18:038:017 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou
           seen the doors of the shadow of death?

18:038:018 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
           knowest it all.

18:038:019 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,
           where is the place thereof,

18:038:020 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that
           thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?

18:038:021 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the
           number of thy days is great?

18:038:022 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou
           seen the treasures of the hail,

18:038:023 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the
           day of battle and war?

18:038:024 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east
           wind upon the earth?

18:038:025 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
           or a way for the lightning of thunder;

18:038:026 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the
           wilderness, wherein there is no man;

18:038:027 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud
           of the tender herb to spring forth?

18:038:028 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

18:038:029 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven,
           who hath gendered it?

18:038:030 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep
           is frozen.

18:038:031 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
           bands of Orion?

18:038:032 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou
           guide Arcturus with his sons?

18:038:033 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the
           dominion thereof in the earth?

18:038:034 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of
           waters may cover thee?

18:038:035 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto
           thee, Here we are?

18:038:036 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given
           understanding to the heart?

18:038:037 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the
           bottles of heaven,

18:038:038 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast
           together?

18:038:039 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of
           the young lions,

18:038:040 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie
           in wait?

18:038:041 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry
           unto God, they wander for lack of meat.

18:039:001 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
           forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

18:039:002 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou
           the time when they bring forth?

18:039:003 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they
           cast out their sorrows.

18:039:004 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;
           they go forth, and return not unto them.

18:039:005 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the
           bands of the wild ass?

18:039:006 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land
           his dwellings.

18:039:007 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he
           the crying of the driver.

18:039:008 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth
           after every green thing.

18:039:009 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy
           crib?

18:039:010 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or
           will he harrow the valleys after thee?

18:039:011 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt
           thou leave thy labour to him?

18:039:012 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and
           gather it into thy barn?

18:039:013 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and
           feathers unto the ostrich?

18:039:014 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,

18:039:015 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild
           beast may break them.

18:039:016 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were
           not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;

18:039:017 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he
           imparted to her understanding.

18:039:018 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the
           horse and his rider.

18:039:019 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck
           with thunder?

18:039:020 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his
           nostrils is terrible.

18:039:021 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he
           goeth on to meet the armed men.

18:039:022 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he
           back from the sword.

18:039:023 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
           shield.

18:039:024 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither
           believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.

18:039:025 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the
           battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the
           shouting.

18:039:026 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
           the south?

18:039:027 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on
           high?

18:039:028 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the
           rock, and the strong place.

18:039:029 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar
           off.

18:039:030 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,
           there is she.

18:040:001 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

18:040:002 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he
           that reproveth God, let him answer it.

18:040:003 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

18:040:004 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine
           hand upon my mouth.

18:040:005 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I
           will proceed no further.

18:040:006 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and
           said,

18:040:007 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and
           declare thou unto me.

18:040:008 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me,
           that thou mayest be righteous?

18:040:009 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice
           like him?

18:040:010 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array
           thyself with glory and beauty.

18:040:011 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that
           is proud, and abase him.

18:040:012 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread
           down the wicked in their place.

18:040:013 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in
           secret.

18:040:014 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand
           can save thee.

18:040:015 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass
           as an ox.

18:040:016 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the
           navel of his belly.

18:040:017 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
           wrapped together.

18:040:018 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like
           bars of iron.

18:040:019 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make
           his sword to approach unto him.

18:040:020 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the
           beasts of the field play.

18:040:021 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and
           fens.

18:040:022 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of
           the brook compass him about.

18:040:023 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth
           that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

18:040:024 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.

18:041:001 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with
           a cord which thou lettest down?

18:041:002 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through
           with a thorn?

18:041:003 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft
           words unto thee?

18:041:004 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a
           servant for ever?

18:041:005 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him
           for thy maidens?

18:041:006 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part
           him among the merchants?

18:041:007 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with
           fish spears?

18:041:008 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

18:041:009 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down
           even at the sight of him?

18:041:010 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to
           stand before me?

18:041:011 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is
           under the whole heaven is mine.

18:041:012 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
           proportion.

18:041:013 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to
           him with his double bridle?

18:041:014 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible
           round about.

18:041:015 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close
           seal.

18:041:016 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

18:041:017 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they
           cannot be sundered.

18:041:018 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the
           eyelids of the morning.

18:041:019 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap
           out.

18:041:020 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or
           caldron.

18:041:021 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

18:041:022 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy
           before him.

18:041:023 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in
           themselves; they cannot be moved.

18:041:024 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of
           the nether millstone.

18:041:025 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason
           of breakings they purify themselves.

18:041:026 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear,
           the dart, nor the habergeon.

18:041:027 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

18:041:028 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with
           him into stubble.

18:041:029 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a
           spear.

18:041:030 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things
           upon the mire.

18:041:031 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like
           a pot of ointment.

18:041:032 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep
           to be hoary.

18:041:033 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

18:041:034 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the
           children of pride.

18:042:001 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

18:042:002 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can
           be withholden from thee.

18:042:003 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore
           have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for
           me, which I knew not.

18:042:004 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,
           and declare thou unto me.

18:042:005 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine
           eye seeth thee.

18:042:006 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.

18:042:007 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
           Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is
           kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have
           not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
           hath.

18:042:008 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and
           go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt
           offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will
           I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye
           have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my
           servant Job.

18:042:009 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
           Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them:
           the LORD also accepted Job.

18:042:010 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for
           his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had
           before.

18:042:011 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his
           sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance
           before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they
           bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the
           LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of
           money, and every one an earring of gold.

18:042:012 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
           beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six
           thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand
           she asses.

18:042:013 He had also seven sons and three daughters.

18:042:014 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of
           the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.

18:042:015 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the
           daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among
           their brethren.

18:042:016 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
           sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.

18:042:017 So Job died, being old and full of days.

Book 19        Psalms

19:001:001 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
           ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in
           the seat of the scornful.

19:001:002 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth
           he meditate day and night.

19:001:003 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
           that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also
           shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

19:001:004 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
           driveth away.

19:001:005 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
           sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

19:001:006 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
           the ungodly shall perish.

19:002:001 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

19:002:002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
           counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed,
           saying,

19:002:003 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords
           from us.

19:002:004 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall
           have them in derision.

19:002:005 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in
           his sore displeasure.

19:002:006 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

19:002:007 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
           art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

19:002:008 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
           inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
           possession.

19:002:009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them
           in pieces like a potter's vessel.

19:002:010 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of
           the earth.

19:002:011 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

19:002:012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
           when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they
           that put their trust in him.

19:003:001 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they
           that rise up against me.

19:003:002 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him
           in God. Selah.

19:003:003 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the
           lifter up of mine head.

19:003:004 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of
           his holy hill. Selah.

19:003:005 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

19:003:006 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
           themselves against me round about.

19:003:007 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all
           mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth
           of the ungodly.

19:003:008 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
           people. Selah.

19:004:001 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast
           enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and
           hear my prayer.

19:004:002 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
           how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

19:004:003 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
           himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

19:004:004 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon
           your bed, and be still. Selah.

19:004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in
           the LORD.

19:004:006 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift
           thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

19:004:007 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
           their corn and their wine increased.

19:004:008 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD,
           only makest me dwell in safety.

19:005:001 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

19:005:002 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for
           unto thee will I pray.

19:005:003 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the
           morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

19:005:004 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
           neither shall evil dwell with thee.

19:005:005 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all
           workers of iniquity.

19:005:006 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will
           abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

19:005:007 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of
           thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
           temple.

19:005:008 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
           make thy way straight before my face.

19:005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part
           is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they
           flatter with their tongue.

19:005:010 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
           cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for
           they have rebelled against thee.

19:005:011 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
           them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them
           also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

19:005:012 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt
           thou compass him as with a shield.

19:006:001 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in
           thy hot displeasure.

19:006:002 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me;
           for my bones are vexed.

19:006:003 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

19:006:004 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'
           sake.

19:006:005 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
           shall give thee thanks?

19:006:006 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to
           swim; I water my couch with my tears.

19:006:007 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because
           of all mine enemies.

19:006:008 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
           heard the voice of my weeping.

19:006:009 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my
           prayer.

19:006:010 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them
           return and be ashamed suddenly.

19:007:001 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all
           them that persecute me, and deliver me:

19:007:002 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
           there is none to deliver.

19:007:003 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my
           hands;

19:007:004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
           (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

19:007:005 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him
           tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the
           dust. Selah.

19:007:006 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the
           rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that
           thou hast commanded.

19:007:007 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
           for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

19:007:008 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according
           to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is
           in me.

19:007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
           establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts
           and reins.

19:007:010 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

19:007:011 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked
           every day.

19:007:012 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow,
           and made it ready.

19:007:013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he
           ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

19:007:014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived
           mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

19:007:015 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch
           which he made.

19:007:016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent
           dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

19:007:017 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and
           will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

19:008:001 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
           who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

19:008:002 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
           strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still
           the enemy and the avenger.

19:008:003 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon
           and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

19:008:004 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
           that thou visitest him?

19:008:005 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and
           hast crowned him with glory and honour.

19:008:006 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
           thou hast put all things under his feet:

19:008:007 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

19:008:008 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
           passeth through the paths of the seas.

19:008:009 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

19:009:001 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew
           forth all thy marvellous works.

19:009:002 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
           name, O thou most High.

19:009:003 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish
           at thy presence.

19:009:004 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in
           the throne judging right.

19:009:005 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
           thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

19:009:006 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and
           thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with
           them.

19:009:007 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his
           throne for judgment.

19:009:008 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
           minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

19:009:009 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
           times of trouble.

19:009:010 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for
           thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

19:009:011 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare
           among the people his doings.

19:009:012 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
           forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

19:009:013 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer
           of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates
           of death:

19:009:014 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the
           daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

19:009:015 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the
           net which they hid is their own foot taken.

19:009:016 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the
           wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.
           Selah.

19:009:017 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that
           forget God.

19:009:018 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of
           the poor shall not perish for ever.

19:009:019 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged
           in thy sight.

19:009:020 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves
           to be but men. Selah.

19:010:001 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in
           times of trouble?

19:010:002 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
           taken in the devices that they have imagined.

19:010:003 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth
           the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

19:010:004 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
           seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.

19:010:005 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out
           of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

19:010:006 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall
           never be in adversity.

19:010:007 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
           tongue is mischief and vanity.

19:010:008 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the
           secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are
           privily set against the poor.

19:010:009 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in
           wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he
           draweth him into his net.

19:010:010 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
           his strong ones.

19:010:011 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
           face; he will never see it.

19:010:012 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the
           humble.

19:010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
           heart, Thou wilt not require it.

19:010:014 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
           requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto
           thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

19:010:015 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out
           his wickedness till thou find none.

19:010:016 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished
           out of his land.

19:010:017 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
           prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

19:010:018 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
           earth may no more oppress.

19:011:001 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a
           bird to your mountain?

19:011:002 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their
           arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the
           upright in heart.

19:011:003 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

19:011:004 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in
           heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

19:011:005 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that
           loveth violence his soul hateth.

19:011:006 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and
           an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.

19:011:007 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance
           doth behold the upright.

19:012:001 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail
           from among the children of men.

19:012:002 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with
           flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

19:012:003 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue
           that speaketh proud things:

19:012:004 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are
           our own: who is lord over us?

19:012:005 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
           now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety
           from him that puffeth at him.

19:012:006 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a
           furnace of earth, purified seven times.

19:012:007 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from
           this generation for ever.

19:012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are
           exalted.

19:013:001 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
           thou hide thy face from me?

19:013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
           heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

19:013:003 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
           sleep the sleep of death;

19:013:004 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those
           that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

19:013:005 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
           salvation.

19:013:006 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully
           with me.

19:014:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
           corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that
           doeth good.

19:014:002 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to
           see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

19:014:003 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:
           there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

19:014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
           people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

19:014:005 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of
           the righteous.

19:014:006 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is
           his refuge.

19:014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when
           the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob
           shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

19:015:001 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in
           thy holy hill?

19:015:002 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
           speaketh the truth in his heart.

19:015:003 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
           neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

19:015:004 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth
           them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and
           changeth not.

19:015:005 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
           against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never
           be moved.

19:016:001 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

19:016:002 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
           goodness extendeth not to thee;

19:016:003 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent,
           in whom is all my delight.

19:016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another
           god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take
           up their names into my lips.

19:016:005 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
           thou maintainest my lot.

19:016:006 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
           goodly heritage.

19:016:007 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins
           also instruct me in the night seasons.

19:016:008 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my
           right hand, I shall not be moved.

19:016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh
           also shall rest in hope.

19:016:010 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
           suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

19:016:011 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness
           of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

19:017:001 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
           prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

19:017:002 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
           behold the things that are equal.

19:017:003 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the
           night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am
           purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

19:017:004 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have
           kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

19:017:005 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

19:017:006 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline
           thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.

19:017:007 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
           right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that
           rise up against them.

19:017:008 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of
           thy wings,

19:017:009 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
           compass me about.

19:017:010 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they
           speak proudly.

19:017:011 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their
           eyes bowing down to the earth;

19:017:012 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
           young lion lurking in secret places.

19:017:013 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul
           from the wicked, which is thy sword:

19:017:014 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
           which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou
           fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and
           leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

19:017:015 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
           satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

19:018:001 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

19:018:002 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my
           God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the
           horn of my salvation, and my high tower.

19:018:003 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so
           shall I be saved from mine enemies.

19:018:004 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly
           men made me afraid.

19:018:005 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
           prevented me.

19:018:006 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God:
           he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before
           him, even into his ears.

19:018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
           hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

19:018:008 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
           mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

19:018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was
           under his feet.

19:018:010 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon
           the wings of the wind.

19:018:011 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about
           him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

19:018:012 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
           hail stones and coals of fire.

19:018:013 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave
           his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

19:018:014 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot
           out lightnings, and discomfited them.

19:018:015 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
           the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast
           of the breath of thy nostrils.

19:018:016 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

19:018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which
           hated me: for they were too strong for me.

19:018:018 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
           my stay.

19:018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
           because he delighted in me.

19:018:020 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according
           to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

19:018:021 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
           departed from my God.

19:018:022 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away
           his statutes from me.

19:018:023 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
           iniquity.

19:018:024 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
           righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his
           eyesight.

19:018:025 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
           upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

19:018:026 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
           froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

19:018:027 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
           high looks.

19:018:028 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten
           my darkness.

19:018:029 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
           leaped over a wall.

19:018:030 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
           he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

19:018:031 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

19:018:032 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
           perfect.

19:018:033 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my
           high places.

19:018:034 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken
           by mine arms.

19:018:035 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
           right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me
           great.

19:018:036 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not
           slip.

19:018:037 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
           turn again till they were consumed.

19:018:038 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
           fallen under my feet.

19:018:039 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou
           hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

19:018:040 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I
           might destroy them that hate me.

19:018:041 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the
           LORD, but he answered them not.

19:018:042 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
           cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

19:018:043 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
           thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I
           have not known shall serve me.

19:018:044 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
           shall submit themselves unto me.

19:018:045 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their
           close places.

19:018:046 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
           salvation be exalted.

19:018:047 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

19:018:048 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
           above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me
           from the violent man.

19:018:049 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
           heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

19:018:050 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
           his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

19:019:001 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
           sheweth his handywork.

19:019:002 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
           knowledge.

19:019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not
           heard.

19:019:004 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words
           to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for
           the sun,

19:019:005 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and
           rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

19:019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
           unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat
           thereof.

19:019:007 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
           testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

19:019:008 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
           commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

19:019:009 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the
           judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

19:019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
           gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

19:019:011 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
           there is great reward.

19:019:012 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
           faults.

19:019:013 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them
           not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I
           shall be innocent from the great transgression.

19:019:014 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
           acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

19:020:001 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God
           of Jacob defend thee;

19:020:002 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
           Zion;

19:020:003 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
           Selah.

19:020:004 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
           counsel.

19:020:005 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God
           we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

19:020:006 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
           from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right
           hand.

19:020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will
           remember the name of the LORD our God.

19:020:008 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
           upright.

19:020:009 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

19:021:001 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy
           salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

19:021:002 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not
           withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

19:021:003 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
           settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

19:021:004 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
           days for ever and ever.

19:021:005 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast
           thou laid upon him.

19:021:006 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made
           him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

19:021:007 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of
           the most High he shall not be moved.

19:021:008 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand
           shall find out those that hate thee.

19:021:009 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine
           anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the
           fire shall devour them.

19:021:010 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
           from among the children of men.

19:021:011 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a
           mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.

19:021:012 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou
           shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the
           face of them.

19:021:013 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing
           and praise thy power.

19:022:001 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
           from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

19:022:002 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in
           the night season, and am not silent.

19:022:003 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of
           Israel.

19:022:004 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst
           deliver them.

19:022:005 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in
           thee, and were not confounded.

19:022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised
           of the people.

19:022:007 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the
           lip, they shake the head, saying,

19:022:008 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him
           deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

19:022:009 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make
           me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

19:022:010 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
           mother's belly.

19:022:011 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
           help.

19:022:012 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have
           beset me round.

19:022:013 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
           roaring lion.

19:022:014 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
           my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

19:022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue
           cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of
           death.

19:022:016 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
           inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

19:022:017 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

19:022:018 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
           vesture.

19:022:019 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee
           to help me.

19:022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of
           the dog.

19:022:021 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
           horns of the unicorns.

19:022:022 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
           congregation will I praise thee.

19:022:023 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
           glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

19:022:024 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
           afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he
           cried unto him, he heard.

19:022:025 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will
           pay my vows before them that fear him.

19:022:026 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the
           LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

19:022:027 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the
           LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
           thee.

19:022:028 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among
           the nations.

19:022:029 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all
           they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none
           can keep alive his own soul.

19:022:030 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for
           a generation.

19:022:031 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
           people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

19:023:001 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

19:023:002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me
           beside the still waters.

19:023:003 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
           righteousness for his name's sake.

19:023:004 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
           I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
           staff they comfort me.

19:023:005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
           enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

19:023:006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
           life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

19:024:001 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world,
           and they that dwell therein.

19:024:002 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon
           the floods.

19:024:003 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand
           in his holy place?

19:024:004 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not
           lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

19:024:005 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
           from the God of his salvation.

19:024:006 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
           face, O Jacob. Selah.

19:024:007 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye
           everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

19:024:008 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the
           LORD mighty in battle.

19:024:009 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye
           everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

19:024:010 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King
           of glory. Selah.

19:025:001 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

19:025:002 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
           enemies triumph over me.

19:025:003 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be
           ashamed which transgress without cause.

19:025:004 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

19:025:005 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
           salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

19:025:006 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
           for they have been ever of old.

19:025:007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
           according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness'
           sake, O LORD.

19:025:008 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners
           in the way.

19:025:009 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
           his way.

19:025:010 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as
           keep his covenant and his testimonies.

19:025:011 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
           great.

19:025:012 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in
           the way that he shall choose.

19:025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
           earth.

19:025:014 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
           shew them his covenant.

19:025:015 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
           out of the net.

19:025:016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate
           and afflicted.

19:025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of
           my distresses.

19:025:018 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my
           sins.

19:025:019 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me
           with cruel hatred.

19:025:020 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I
           put my trust in thee.

19:025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

19:025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

19:026:001 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have
           trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

19:026:002 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

19:026:003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked
           in thy truth.

19:026:004 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
           dissemblers.

19:026:005 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
           with the wicked.

19:026:006 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
           altar, O LORD:

19:026:007 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
           all thy wondrous works.

19:026:008 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
           where thine honour dwelleth.

19:026:009 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

19:026:010 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
           bribes.

19:026:011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and
           be merciful unto me.

19:026:012 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I
           bless the LORD.

19:027:001 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
           LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

19:027:002 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
           to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

19:027:003 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
           fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be
           confident.

19:027:004 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
           that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my
           life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his
           temple.

19:027:005 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
           in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set
           me up upon a rock.

19:027:006 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
           about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices
           of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

19:027:007 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon
           me, and answer me.

19:027:008 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,
           Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

19:027:009 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in
           anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake
           me, O God of my salvation.

19:027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will
           take me up.

19:027:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
           of mine enemies.

19:027:012 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
           witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out
           cruelty.

19:027:013 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of
           the LORD in the land of the living.

19:027:014 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
           thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

19:028:001 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me:
           lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down
           into the pit.

19:028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when
           I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

19:028:003 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
           iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief
           is in their hearts.

19:028:004 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
           wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of
           their hands; render to them their desert.

19:028:005 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the
           operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build
           them up.

19:028:006 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
           supplications.

19:028:007 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in
           him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
           and with my song will I praise him.

19:028:008 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of
           his anointed.

19:028:009 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also,
           and lift them up for ever.

19:029:001 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
           strength.

19:029:002 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the
           LORD in the beauty of holiness.

19:029:003 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
           thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.

19:029:004 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is
           full of majesty.

19:029:005 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD
           breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

19:029:006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion
           like a young unicorn.

19:029:007 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

19:029:008 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
           the wilderness of Kadesh.

19:029:009 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and
           discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one
           speak of his glory.

19:029:010 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King
           for ever.

19:029:011 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will
           bless his people with peace.

19:030:001 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and
           hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

19:030:002 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

19:030:003 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
           kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

19:030:004 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
           remembrance of his holiness.

19:030:005 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
           weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

19:030:006 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

19:030:007 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand
           strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

19:030:008 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made
           supplication.

19:030:009 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
           Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

19:030:010 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

19:030:011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast
           put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

19:030:012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
           silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

19:031:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
           deliver me in thy righteousness.

19:031:002 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my
           strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.

19:031:003 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's
           sake lead me, and guide me.

19:031:004 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
           thou art my strength.

19:031:005 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O
           LORD God of truth.

19:031:006 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in
           the LORD.

19:031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast
           considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

19:031:008 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast
           set my feet in a large room.

19:031:009 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
           consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

19:031:010 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
           strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are
           consumed.

19:031:011 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among
           my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did
           see me without fled from me.

19:031:012 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
           vessel.

19:031:013 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
           while they took counsel together against me, they devised to
           take away my life.

19:031:014 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.

19:031:015 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
           enemies, and from them that persecute me.

19:031:016 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
           mercies' sake.

19:031:017 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee:
           let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the
           grave.

19:031:018 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
           things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

19:031:019 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
           that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in
           thee before the sons of men!

19:031:020 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
           pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from
           the strife of tongues.

19:031:021 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
           kindness in a strong city.

19:031:022 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
           nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when
           I cried unto thee.

19:031:023 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth
           the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

19:031:024 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
           that hope in the LORD.

19:032:001 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
           covered.

19:032:002 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,
           and in whose spirit there is no guile.

19:032:003 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
           the day long.

19:032:004 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
           turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

19:032:005 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
           hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD;
           and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

19:032:006 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a
           time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
           waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

19:032:007 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
           thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

19:032:008 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
           shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

19:032:009 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
           understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and
           bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

19:032:010 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in
           the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

19:032:011 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
           joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

19:033:001 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for
           the upright.

19:033:002 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and
           an instrument of ten strings.

19:033:003 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

19:033:004 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done
           in truth.

19:033:005 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
           goodness of the LORD.

19:033:006 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the
           host of them by the breath of his mouth.

19:033:007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he
           layeth up the depth in storehouses.

19:033:008 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of
           the world stand in awe of him.

19:033:009 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood
           fast.

19:033:010 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
           maketh the devices of the people of none effect.

19:033:011 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
           heart to all generations.

19:033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people
           whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

19:033:013 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of
           men.

19:033:014 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
           inhabitants of the earth.

19:033:015 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
           works.

19:033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty
           man is not delivered by much strength.

19:033:017 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
           any by his great strength.

19:033:018 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
           them that hope in his mercy;

19:033:019 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
           famine.

19:033:020 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

19:033:021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
           his holy name.

19:033:022 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in
           thee.

19:034:001 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall
           continually be in my mouth.

19:034:002 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall
           hear thereof, and be glad.

19:034:003 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name
           together.

19:034:004 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all
           my fears.

19:034:005 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
           not ashamed.

19:034:006 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out
           of all his troubles.

19:034:007 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear
           him, and delivereth them.

19:034:008 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
           trusteth in him.

19:034:009 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
           that fear him.

19:034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
           the LORD shall not want any good thing.

19:034:011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear
           of the LORD.

19:034:012 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that
           he may see good?

19:034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

19:034:014 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

19:034:015 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
           open unto their cry.

19:034:016 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
           the remembrance of them from the earth.

19:034:017 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them
           out of all their troubles.

19:034:018 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
           saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

19:034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD
           delivereth him out of them all.

19:034:020 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

19:034:021 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
           shall be desolate.

19:034:022 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them
           that trust in him shall be desolate.

19:035:001 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
           against them that fight against me.

19:035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

19:035:003 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
           persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

19:035:004 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my
           soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that
           devise my hurt.

19:035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
           LORD chase them.

19:035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the
           LORD persecute them.

19:035:007 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
           which without cause they have digged for my soul.

19:035:008 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net
           that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let
           him fall.

19:035:009 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in
           his salvation.

19:035:010 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
           deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea,
           the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

19:035:011 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things
           that I knew not.

19:035:012 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

19:035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:
           I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into
           mine own bosom.

19:035:014 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
           bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.

19:035:015 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
           together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together
           against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased
           not:

19:035:016 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
           their teeth.

19:035:017 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
           destructions, my darling from the lions.

19:035:018 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will
           praise thee among much people.

19:035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
           neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a
           cause.

19:035:020 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
           against them that are quiet in the land.

19:035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
           aha, our eye hath seen it.

19:035:022 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
           far from me.

19:035:023 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
           my God and my Lord.

19:035:024 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and
           let them not rejoice over me.

19:035:025 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let
           them not say, We have swallowed him up.

19:035:026 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
           rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and
           dishonour that magnify themselves against me.

19:035:027 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
           cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be
           magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
           servant.

19:035:028 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy
           praise all the day long.

19:036:001 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that
           there is no fear of God before his eyes.

19:036:002 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity
           be found to be hateful.

19:036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left
           off to be wise, and to do good.

19:036:004 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
           that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

19:036:005 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
           reacheth unto the clouds.

19:036:006 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments
           are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

19:036:007 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
           children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

19:036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy
           house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy
           pleasures.

19:036:009 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we
           see light.

19:036:010 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and
           thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

19:036:011 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the
           hand of the wicked remove me.

19:036:012 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
           and shall not be able to rise.

19:037:001 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
           against the workers of iniquity.

19:037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
           the green herb.

19:037:003 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the
           land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

19:037:004 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
           desires of thine heart.

19:037:005 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
           bring it to pass.

19:037:006 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and
           thy judgment as the noonday.

19:037:007 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
           because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man
           who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

19:037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any
           wise to do evil.

19:037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
           LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

19:037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
           shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

19:037:011 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
           themselves in the abundance of peace.

19:037:012 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him
           with his teeth.

19:037:013 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
           coming.

19:037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
           to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of
           upright conversation.

19:037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
           shall be broken.

19:037:016 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches
           of many wicked.

19:037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
           upholdeth the righteous.

19:037:018 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their
           inheritance shall be for ever.

19:037:019 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
           famine they shall be satisfied.

19:037:020 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
           be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall
           they consume away.

19:037:021 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
           sheweth mercy, and giveth.

19:037:022 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and
           they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.

19:037:023 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
           delighteth in his way.

19:037:024 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
           LORD upholdeth him with his hand.

19:037:025 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
           righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

19:037:026 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

19:037:027 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

19:037:028 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints;
           they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall
           be cut off.

19:037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
           ever.

19:037:030 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
           talketh of judgment.

19:037:031 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
           slide.

19:037:032 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

19:037:033 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
           he is judged.

19:037:034 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
           inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see
           it.

19:037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
           like a green bay tree.

19:037:036 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him,
           but he could not be found.

19:037:037 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
           that man is peace.

19:037:038 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
           the wicked shall be cut off.

19:037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
           strength in the time of trouble.

19:037:040 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall
           deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they
           trust in him.

19:038:001 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy
           hot displeasure.

19:038:002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me
           sore.

19:038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
           neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

19:038:004 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy
           burden they are too heavy for me.

19:038:005 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

19:038:006 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the
           day long.

19:038:007 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is
           no soundness in my flesh.

19:038:008 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
           disquietness of my heart.

19:038:009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
           from thee.

19:038:010 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
           mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

19:038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
           kinsmen stand afar off.

19:038:012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
           that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine
           deceits all the day long.

19:038:013 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
           openeth not his mouth.

19:038:014 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are
           no reproofs.

19:038:015 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

19:038:016 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over
           me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

19:038:017 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before
           me.

19:038:018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

19:038:019 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they
           that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

19:038:020 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
           because I follow the thing that good is.

19:038:021 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

19:038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.

19:039:001 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
           tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked
           is before me.

19:039:002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and
           my sorrow was stirred.

19:039:003 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire
           burned: then spake I with my tongue,

19:039:004 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,
           what it is: that I may know how frail I am.

19:039:005 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age
           is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state
           is altogether vanity. Selah.

19:039:006 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
           disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who
           shall gather them.

19:039:007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

19:039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the
           reproach of the foolish.

19:039:009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.

19:039:010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
           thine hand.

19:039:011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
           makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every
           man is vanity. Selah.

19:039:012 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
           peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a
           sojourner, as all my fathers were.

19:039:013 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence,
           and be no more.

19:040:001 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
           heard my cry.

19:040:002 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
           clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

19:040:003 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our
           God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

19:040:004 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
           respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

19:040:005 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
           done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be
           reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak
           of them, they are more than can be numbered.

19:040:006 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
           thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not
           required.

19:040:007 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
           written of me,

19:040:008 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
           heart.

19:040:009 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
           have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

19:040:010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
           declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not
           concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
           congregation.

19:040:011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
           lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

19:040:012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
           have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
           they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart
           faileth me.

19:040:013 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
           me.

19:040:014 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
           soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to
           shame that wish me evil.

19:040:015 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
           me, Aha, aha.

19:040:016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
           such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be
           magnified.

19:040:017 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou
           art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

19:041:001 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
           him in time of trouble.

19:041:002 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall
           be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto
           the will of his enemies.

19:041:003 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
           wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

19:041:004 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
           sinned against thee.

19:041:005 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
           perish?

19:041:006 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart
           gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth
           it.

19:041:007 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do
           they devise my hurt.

19:041:008 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now
           that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

19:041:009 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did
           eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

19:041:010 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
           may requite them.

19:041:011 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
           not triumph over me.

19:041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and
           settest me before thy face for ever.

19:041:013 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
           everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

19:042:001 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
           after thee, O God.

19:042:002 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
           come and appear before God?

19:042:003 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they
           continually say unto me, Where is thy God?

19:042:004 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I
           had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of
           God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that
           kept holyday.

19:042:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
           in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the
           help of his countenance.

19:042:006 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
           remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites,
           from the hill Mizar.

19:042:007 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all
           thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

19:042:008 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time,
           and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto
           the God of my life.

19:042:009 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why
           go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

19:042:010 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
           they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

19:042:011 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
           within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who
           is the health of my countenance, and my God.

19:043:001 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:
           O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

19:043:002 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me
           off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

19:043:003 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
           bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

19:043:004 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding
           joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

19:043:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
           within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the
           health of my countenance, and my God.

19:044:001 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
           what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

19:044:002 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and
           plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast
           them out.

19:044:003 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
           neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and
           thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou
           hadst a favour unto them.

19:044:004 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

19:044:005 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name
           will we tread them under that rise up against us.

19:044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save
           me.

19:044:007 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
           shame that hated us.

19:044:008 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for
           ever. Selah.

19:044:009 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not
           forth with our armies.

19:044:010 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which
           hate us spoil for themselves.

19:044:011 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
           scattered us among the heathen.

19:044:012 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
           wealth by their price.

19:044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
           derision to them that are round about us.

19:044:014 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the
           head among the people.

19:044:015 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my
           face hath covered me,

19:044:016 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by
           reason of the enemy and avenger.

19:044:017 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
           neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

19:044:018 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
           from thy way;

19:044:019 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
           covered us with the shadow of death.

19:044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
           hands to a strange god;

19:044:021 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of
           the heart.

19:044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are
           counted as sheep for the slaughter.

19:044:023 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
           ever.

19:044:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
           and our oppression?

19:044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth
           unto the earth.

19:044:026 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

19:045:001 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things
           which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a
           ready writer.

19:045:002 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
           thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

19:045:003 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory
           and thy majesty.

19:045:004 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
           meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
           thee terrible things.

19:045:005 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
           whereby the people fall under thee.

19:045:006 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
           kingdom is a right sceptre.

19:045:007 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore
           God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
           above thy fellows.

19:045:008 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
           the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

19:045:009 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy
           right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

19:045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
           forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;

19:045:011 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy
           Lord; and worship thou him.

19:045:012 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
           rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

19:045:013 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
           wrought gold.

19:045:014 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:
           the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought
           unto thee.

19:045:015 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall
           enter into the king's palace.

19:045:016 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
           make princes in all the earth.

19:045:017 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
           therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

19:046:001 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
           trouble.

19:046:002 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
           though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

19:046:003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
           mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

19:046:004 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city
           of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

19:046:005 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall
           help her, and that right early.

19:046:006 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his
           voice, the earth melted.

19:046:007 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
           Selah.

19:046:008 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath
           made in the earth.

19:046:009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
           the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the
           chariot in the fire.

19:046:010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
           heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

19:046:011 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
           Selah.

19:047:001 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the
           voice of triumph.

19:047:002 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over
           all the earth.

19:047:003 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
           feet.

19:047:004 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of
           Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

19:047:005 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
           trumpet.

19:047:006 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
           sing praises.

19:047:007 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
           understanding.

19:047:008 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of
           his holiness.

19:047:009 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the
           people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth
           belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

19:048:001 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of
           our God, in the mountain of his holiness.

19:048:002 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
           Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

19:048:003 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

19:048:004 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

19:048:005 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
           hasted away.

19:048:006 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
           travail.

19:048:007 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

19:048:008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
           hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
           Selah.

19:048:009 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of
           thy temple.

19:048:010 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends
           of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

19:048:011 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
           because of thy judgments.

19:048:012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
           thereof.

19:048:013 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
           tell it to the generation following.

19:048:014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our
           guide even unto death.

19:049:001 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
           world:

19:049:002 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

19:049:003 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
           shall be of understanding.

19:049:004 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark
           saying upon the harp.

19:049:005 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity
           of my heels shall compass me about?

19:049:006 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
           multitude of their riches;

19:049:007 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to
           God a ransom for him:

19:049:008 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth
           for ever:)

19:049:009 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

19:049:010 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
           brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

19:049:011 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
           ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call
           their lands after their own names.

19:049:012 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
           beasts that perish.

19:049:013 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve
           their sayings. Selah.

19:049:014 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on
           them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the
           morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from
           their dwelling.

19:049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for
           he shall receive me. Selah.

19:049:016 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of
           his house is increased;

19:049:017 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
           not descend after him.

19:049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
           thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

19:049:019 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
           see light.

19:049:020 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the
           beasts that perish.

19:050:001 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the
           earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

19:050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

19:050:003 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
           devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
           about him.

19:050:004 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,
           that he may judge his people.

19:050:005 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
           covenant with me by sacrifice.

19:050:006 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is
           judge himself. Selah.

19:050:007 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will
           testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.

19:050:008 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
           offerings, to have been continually before me.

19:050:009 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of
           thy folds.

19:050:010 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
           thousand hills.

19:050:011 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
           the field are mine.

19:050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is
           mine, and the fulness thereof.

19:050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

19:050:014 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
           High:

19:050:015 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
           and thou shalt glorify me.

19:050:016 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
           my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
           mouth?

19:050:017 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
           thee.

19:050:018 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
           hast been partaker with adulterers.

19:050:019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

19:050:020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
           thine own mother's son.

19:050:021 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou
           thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I
           will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

19:050:022 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
           pieces, and there be none to deliver.

19:050:023 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
           his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

19:051:001 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
           according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
           transgressions.

19:051:002 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
           sin.

19:051:003 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
           me.

19:051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
           thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
           and be clear when thou judgest.

19:051:005 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
           conceive me.

19:051:006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
           hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

19:051:007 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
           shall be whiter than snow.

19:051:008 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou
           hast broken may rejoice.

19:051:009 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

19:051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
           within me.

19:051:011 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy
           spirit from me.

19:051:012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with
           thy free spirit.

19:051:013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
           converted unto thee.

19:051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
           salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
           righteousness.

19:051:015 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
           praise.

19:051:016 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
           delightest not in burnt offering.

19:051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
           contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

19:051:018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls
           of Jerusalem.

19:051:019 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of
           righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
           then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

19:052:001 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the
           goodness of God endureth continually.

19:052:002 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
           deceitfully.

19:052:003 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to
           speak righteousness. Selah.

19:052:004 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

19:052:005 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
           away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee
           out of the land of the living. Selah.

19:052:006 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at
           him:

19:052:007 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but
           trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
           himself in his wickedness.

19:052:008 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust
           in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

19:052:009 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
           will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.

19:053:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
           they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that
           doeth good.

19:053:002 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
           if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.

19:053:003 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
           filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

19:053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
           people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

19:053:005 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
           scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou
           hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.

19:053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When
           God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall
           rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

19:054:001 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

19:054:002 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

19:054:003 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek
           after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

19:054:004 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold
           my soul.

19:054:005 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
           truth.

19:054:006 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
           LORD; for it is good.

19:054:007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
           seen his desire upon mine enemies.

19:055:001 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
           supplication.

19:055:002 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make
           a noise;

19:055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression
           of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath
           they hate me.

19:055:004 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death
           are fallen upon me.

19:055:005 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
           overwhelmed me.

19:055:006 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I
           fly away, and be at rest.

19:055:007 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
           Selah.

19:055:008 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

19:055:009 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
           violence and strife in the city.

19:055:010 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
           mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

19:055:011 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart
           not from her streets.

19:055:012 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
           borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify
           himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

19:055:013 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
           acquaintance.

19:055:014 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of
           God in company.

19:055:015 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into
           hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

19:055:016 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

19:055:017 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
           and he shall hear my voice.

19:055:018 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
           against me: for there were many with me.

19:055:019 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
           Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not
           God.

19:055:020 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
           him: he hath broken his covenant.

19:055:021 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was
           in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they
           drawn swords.

19:055:022 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
           shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

19:055:023 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
           destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half
           their days; but I will trust in thee.

19:056:001 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
           fighting daily oppresseth me.

19:056:002 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
           fight against me, O thou most High.

19:056:003 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

19:056:004 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I
           will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

19:056:005 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against
           me for evil.

19:056:006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they
           mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

19:056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
           people, O God.

19:056:008 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
           are they not in thy book?

19:056:009 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this
           I know; for God is for me.

19:056:010 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
           word.

19:056:011 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can
           do unto me.

19:056:012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

19:056:013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
           deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in
           the light of the living?

19:057:001 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
           trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make
           my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.

19:057:002 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
           things for me.

19:057:003 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of
           him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his
           mercy and his truth.

19:057:004 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set
           on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
           arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

19:057:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be
           above all the earth.

19:057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
           they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they
           are fallen themselves. Selah.

19:057:007 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and
           give praise.

19:057:008 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will
           awake early.

19:057:009 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
           thee among the nations.

19:057:010 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto
           the clouds.

19:057:011 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
           above all the earth.

19:058:001 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
           uprightly, O ye sons of men?

19:058:002 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of
           your hands in the earth.

19:058:003 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon
           as they be born, speaking lies.

19:058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like
           the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

19:058:005 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
           never so wisely.

19:058:006 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
           teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

19:058:007 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
           bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in
           pieces.

19:058:008 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away:
           like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the
           sun.

19:058:009 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away
           as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

19:058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
           shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

19:058:011 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
           righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

19:059:001 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them
           that rise up against me.

19:059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from
           bloody men.

19:059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
           against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

19:059:004 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to
           help me, and behold.

19:059:005 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake
           to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked
           transgressors. Selah.

19:059:006 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
           round about the city.

19:059:007 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
           lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

19:059:008 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
           heathen in derision.

19:059:009 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
           defence.

19:059:010 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my
           desire upon mine enemies.

19:059:011 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy
           power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

19:059:012 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let
           them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying
           which they speak.

19:059:013 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
           let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the
           earth. Selah.

19:059:014 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like
           a dog, and go round about the city.

19:059:015 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be
           not satisfied.

19:059:016 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
           mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge
           in the day of my trouble.

19:059:017 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
           and the God of my mercy.

19:060:001 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou
           hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

19:060:002 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
           the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

19:060:003 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to
           drink the wine of astonishment.

19:060:004 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may
           be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

19:060:005 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand,
           and hear me.

19:060:006 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
           Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

19:060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
           strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

19:060:008 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe:
           Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

19:060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
           Edom?

19:060:010 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O
           God, which didst not go out with our armies?

19:060:011 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

19:060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
           tread down our enemies.

19:061:001 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

19:061:002 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart
           is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

19:061:003 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from
           the enemy.

19:061:004 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
           covert of thy wings. Selah.

19:061:005 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the
           heritage of those that fear thy name.

19:061:006 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many
           generations.

19:061:007 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
           which may preserve him.

19:061:008 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
           perform my vows.

19:062:001 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

19:062:002 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
           not be greatly moved.

19:062:003 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
           slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a
           tottering fence.

19:062:004 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
           delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse
           inwardly. Selah.

19:062:005 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from
           him.

19:062:006 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall
           not be moved.

19:062:007 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,
           and my refuge, is in God.

19:062:008 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart
           before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

19:062:009 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree
           are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether
           lighter than vanity.

19:062:010 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
           riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

19:062:011 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
           belongeth unto God.

19:062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
           every man according to his work.

19:063:001 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
           thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
           thirsty land, where no water is;

19:063:002 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
           sanctuary.

19:063:003 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
           praise thee.

19:063:004 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands
           in thy name.

19:063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
           mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:

19:063:006 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
           night watches.

19:063:007 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
           wings will I rejoice.

19:063:008 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth
           me.

19:063:009 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
           lower parts of the earth.

19:063:010 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for
           foxes.

19:063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
           him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall
           be stopped.

19:064:001 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear
           of the enemy.

19:064:002 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
           insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

19:064:003 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to
           shoot their arrows, even bitter words:

19:064:004 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
           shoot at him, and fear not.

19:064:005 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
           laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

19:064:006 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
           both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart,
           is deep.

19:064:007 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they
           be wounded.

19:064:008 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
           all that see them shall flee away.

19:064:009 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
           they shall wisely consider of his doing.

19:064:010 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in
           him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

19:065:001 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall
           the vow be performed.

19:065:002 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

19:065:003 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou
           shalt purge them away.

19:065:004 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
           unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be
           satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy
           temple.

19:065:005 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God
           of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of
           the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

19:065:006 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
           with power:

19:065:007 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their
           waves, and the tumult of the people.

19:065:008 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
           tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening
           to rejoice.

19:065:009 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly
           enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water:
           thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

19:065:010 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
           furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou
           blessest the springing thereof.

19:065:011 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
           fatness.

19:065:012 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
           hills rejoice on every side.

19:065:013 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
           covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

19:066:001 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

19:066:002 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

19:066:003 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
           greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves
           unto thee.

19:066:004 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee;
           they shall sing to thy name. Selah.

19:066:005 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing
           toward the children of men.

19:066:006 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood
           on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

19:066:007 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
           let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

19:066:008 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise
           to be heard:

19:066:009 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to
           be moved.

19:066:010 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
           is tried.

19:066:011 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon
           our loins.

19:066:012 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
           fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a
           wealthy place.

19:066:013 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee
           my vows,

19:066:014 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I
           was in trouble.

19:066:015 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
           incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

19:066:016 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what
           he hath done for my soul.

19:066:017 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
           tongue.

19:066:018 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

19:066:019 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
           my prayer.

19:066:020 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
           mercy from me.

19:067:001 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
           shine upon us; Selah.

19:067:002 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among
           all nations.

19:067:003 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
           thee.

19:067:004 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt
           judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon
           earth. Selah.

19:067:005 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
           thee.

19:067:006 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
           God, shall bless us.

19:067:007 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear
           him.

19:068:001 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also
           that hate him flee before him.

19:068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
           before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of
           God.

19:068:003 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:
           yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

19:068:004 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
           upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

19:068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God
           in his holy habitation.

19:068:006 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those
           which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry
           land.

19:068:007 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou
           didst march through the wilderness; Selah:

19:068:008 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of
           God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the
           God of Israel.

19:068:009 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
           confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

19:068:010 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast
           prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

19:068:011 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
           published it.

19:068:012 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
           divided the spoil.

19:068:013 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the
           wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with
           yellow gold.

19:068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow
           in Salmon.

19:068:015 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
           hill of Bashan.

19:068:016 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God
           desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

19:068:017 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
           angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy
           place.

19:068:018 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
           thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious
           also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.

19:068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
           the God of our salvation. Selah.

19:068:020 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
           Lord belong the issues from death.

19:068:021 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy
           scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

19:068:022 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
           people again from the depths of the sea:

19:068:023 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
           the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

19:068:024 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God,
           my King, in the sanctuary.

19:068:025 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
           after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

19:068:026 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
           fountain of Israel.

19:068:027 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of
           Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the
           princes of Naphtali.

19:068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that
           which thou hast wrought for us.

19:068:029 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
           unto thee.

19:068:030 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls,
           with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself
           with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in
           war.

19:068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch
           out her hands unto God.

19:068:032 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto
           the Lord; Selah:

19:068:033 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
           old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

19:068:034 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel,
           and his strength is in the clouds.

19:068:035 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of
           Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.
           Blessed be God.

19:069:001 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

19:069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come
           into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

19:069:003 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail
           while I wait for my God.

19:069:004 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
           mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies
           wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not
           away.

19:069:005 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid
           from thee.

19:069:006 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be
           ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be
           confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

19:069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered
           my face.

19:069:008 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
           mother's children.

19:069:009 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the
           reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

19:069:010 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to
           my reproach.

19:069:011 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
           them.

19:069:012 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
           of the drunkards.

19:069:013 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an
           acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me,
           in the truth of thy salvation.

19:069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
           delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

19:069:015 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep
           swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

19:069:016 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
           according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

19:069:017 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
           hear me speedily.

19:069:018 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
           mine enemies.

19:069:019 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
           mine adversaries are all before thee.

19:069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and
           I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for
           comforters, but I found none.

19:069:021 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
           me vinegar to drink.

19:069:022 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
           should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

19:069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
           loins continually to shake.

19:069:024 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful
           anger take hold of them.

19:069:025 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
           tents.

19:069:026 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk
           to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

19:069:027 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into
           thy righteousness.

19:069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
           written with the righteous.

19:069:029 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me
           up on high.

19:069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
           him with thanksgiving.

19:069:031 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
           that hath horns and hoofs.

19:069:032 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
           live that seek God.

19:069:033 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his
           prisoners.

19:069:034 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
           that moveth therein.

19:069:035 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah:
           that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

19:069:036 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that
           love his name shall dwell therein.

19:070:001 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O
           LORD.

19:070:002 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul:
           let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire
           my hurt.

19:070:003 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
           Aha, aha.

19:070:004 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and
           let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be
           magnified.

19:070:005 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art
           my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

19:071:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
           confusion.

19:071:002 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape:
           incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

19:071:003 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually
           resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art
           my rock and my fortress.

19:071:004 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of
           the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

19:071:005 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
           youth.

19:071:006 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
           took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be
           continually of thee.

19:071:007 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

19:071:008 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
           the day.

19:071:009 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
           strength faileth.

19:071:010 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for
           my soul take counsel together,

19:071:011 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for
           there is none to deliver him.

19:071:012 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

19:071:013 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
           soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that
           seek my hurt.

19:071:014 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
           more.

19:071:015 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
           all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

19:071:016 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
           of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

19:071:017 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
           declared thy wondrous works.

19:071:018 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
           until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy
           power to every one that is to come.

19:071:019 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done
           great things: O God, who is like unto thee!

19:071:020 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
           quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths
           of the earth.

19:071:021 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every
           side.

19:071:022 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O
           my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One
           of Israel.

19:071:023 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
           soul, which thou hast redeemed.

19:071:024 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
           long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto
           shame, that seek my hurt.

19:072:001 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
           the king's son.

19:072:002 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor
           with judgment.

19:072:003 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
           hills, by righteousness.

19:072:004 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the
           children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the
           oppressor.

19:072:005 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
           throughout all generations.

19:072:006 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers
           that water the earth.

19:072:007 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of
           peace so long as the moon endureth.

19:072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the
           river unto the ends of the earth.

19:072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and
           his enemies shall lick the dust.

19:072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
           the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

19:072:011 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
           serve him.

19:072:012 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
           and him that hath no helper.

19:072:013 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
           the needy.

19:072:014 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
           precious shall their blood be in his sight.

19:072:015 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
           Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and
           daily shall he be praised.

19:072:016 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
           the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and
           they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

19:072:017 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
           long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations
           shall call him blessed.

19:072:018 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
           wondrous things.

19:072:019 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
           earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

19:072:020 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

19:073:001 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
           heart.

19:073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well
           nigh slipped.

19:073:003 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
           the wicked.

19:073:004 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
           firm.

19:073:005 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
           like other men.

19:073:006 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
           covereth them as a garment.

19:073:007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
           could wish.

19:073:008 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
           they speak loftily.

19:073:009 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
           walketh through the earth.

19:073:010 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup
           are wrung out to them.

19:073:011 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
           most High?

19:073:012 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
           increase in riches.

19:073:013 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands
           in innocency.

19:073:014 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
           morning.

19:073:015 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against
           the generation of thy children.

19:073:016 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

19:073:017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I
           their end.

19:073:018 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
           them down into destruction.

19:073:019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
           utterly consumed with terrors.

19:073:020 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest,
           thou shalt despise their image.

19:073:021 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

19:073:022 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.

19:073:023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me
           by my right hand.

19:073:024 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
           to glory.

19:073:025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
           that I desire beside thee.

19:073:026 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
           heart, and my portion for ever.

19:073:027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
           destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

19:073:028 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
           in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

19:074:001 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine
           anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

19:074:002 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;
           the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this
           mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

19:074:003 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
           the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

19:074:004 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set
           up their ensigns for signs.

19:074:005 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
           thick trees.

19:074:006 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with
           axes and hammers.

19:074:007 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
           casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

19:074:008 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
           have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

19:074:009 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
           there among us any that knoweth how long.

19:074:010 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
           blaspheme thy name for ever?

19:074:011 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it
           out of thy bosom.

19:074:012 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of
           the earth.

19:074:013 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
           heads of the dragons in the waters.

19:074:014 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him
           to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

19:074:015 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
           mighty rivers.

19:074:016 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
           the light and the sun.

19:074:017 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
           summer and winter.

19:074:018 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and
           that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

19:074:019 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
           the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

19:074:020 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the
           earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

19:074:021 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
           praise thy name.

19:074:022 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
           man reproacheth thee daily.

19:074:023 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those
           that rise up against thee increaseth continually.

19:075:001 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give
           thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

19:075:002 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

19:075:003 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I
           bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

19:075:004 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
           Lift not up the horn:

19:075:005 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.

19:075:006 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
           nor from the south.

19:075:007 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
           another.

19:075:008 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is
           red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same:
           but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring
           them out, and drink them.

19:075:009 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
           Jacob.

19:075:010 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
           of the righteous shall be exalted.

19:076:001 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

19:076:002 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in
           Zion.

19:076:003 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the
           sword, and the battle. Selah.

19:076:004 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of
           prey.

19:076:005 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
           none of the men of might have found their hands.

19:076:006 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
           cast into a dead sleep.

19:076:007 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy
           sight when once thou art angry?

19:076:008 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
           feared, and was still,

19:076:009 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
           Selah.

19:076:010 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
           wrath shalt thou restrain.

19:076:011 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round
           about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

19:076:012 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
           kings of the earth.

19:077:001 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice;
           and he gave ear unto me.

19:077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
           night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

19:077:003 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my
           spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

19:077:004 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
           speak.

19:077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

19:077:006 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with
           mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

19:077:007 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
           more?

19:077:008 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
           evermore?

19:077:009 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up
           his tender mercies? Selah.

19:077:010 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the
           years of the right hand of the most High.

19:077:011 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
           thy wonders of old.

19:077:012 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

19:077:013 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as
           our God?

19:077:014 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
           strength among the people.

19:077:015 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of
           Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

19:077:016 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
           afraid: the depths also were troubled.

19:077:017 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
           arrows also went abroad.

19:077:018 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
           lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

19:077:019 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and
           thy footsteps are not known.

19:077:020 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
           Aaron.

19:078:001 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the
           words of my mouth.

19:078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings
           of old:

19:078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

19:078:004 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
           generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength,
           and his wonderful works that he hath done.

19:078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law
           in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should
           make them known to their children:

19:078:006 That the generation to come might know them, even the children
           which should be born; who should arise and declare them to
           their children:

19:078:007 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the
           works of God, but keep his commandments:

19:078:008 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
           generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and
           whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

19:078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
           turned back in the day of battle.

19:078:010 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
           law;

19:078:011 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

19:078:012 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
           land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

19:078:013 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he
           made the waters to stand as an heap.

19:078:014 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the
           night with a light of fire.

19:078:015 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as
           out of the great depths.

19:078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
           run down like rivers.

19:078:017 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most
           High in the wilderness.

19:078:018 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
           lust.

19:078:019 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a
           table in the wilderness?

19:078:020 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
           streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide
           flesh for his people?

19:078:021 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
           kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

19:078:022 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
           salvation:

19:078:023 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
           doors of heaven,

19:078:024 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
           of the corn of heaven.

19:078:025 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

19:078:026 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
           he brought in the south wind.

19:078:027 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
           like as the sand of the sea:

19:078:028 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about
           their habitations.

19:078:029 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
           own desire;

19:078:030 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
           was yet in their mouths,

19:078:031 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
           and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

19:078:032 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
           wondrous works.

19:078:033 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
           in trouble.

19:078:034 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
           enquired early after God.

19:078:035 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
           their redeemer.

19:078:036 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
           lied unto him with their tongues.

19:078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
           stedfast in his covenant.

19:078:038 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
           destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
           and did not stir up all his wrath.

19:078:039 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that
           passeth away, and cometh not again.

19:078:040 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
           in the desert!

19:078:041 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy
           One of Israel.

19:078:042 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered
           them from the enemy.

19:078:043 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
           field of Zoan.

19:078:044 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
           they could not drink.

19:078:045 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
           and frogs, which destroyed them.

19:078:046 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
           labour unto the locust.

19:078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
           with frost.

19:078:048 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
           hot thunderbolts.

19:078:049 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
           indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

19:078:050 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from
           death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

19:078:051 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
           strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

19:078:052 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided
           them in the wilderness like a flock.

19:078:053 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the
           sea overwhelmed their enemies.

19:078:054 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
           this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

19:078:055 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
           inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in
           their tents.

19:078:056 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
           his testimonies:

19:078:057 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
           they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

19:078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
           moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

19:078:059 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
           Israel:

19:078:060 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
           placed among men;

19:078:061 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
           the enemy's hand.

19:078:062 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth
           with his inheritance.

19:078:063 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
           given to marriage.

19:078:064 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
           lamentation.

19:078:065 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty
           man that shouteth by reason of wine.

19:078:066 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
           perpetual reproach.

19:078:067 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not
           the tribe of Ephraim:

19:078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

19:078:069 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
           which he hath established for ever.

19:078:070 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
           sheepfolds:

19:078:071 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to
           feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

19:078:072 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
           guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

19:079:001 O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
           temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

19:079:002 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat
           unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the
           beasts of the earth.

19:079:003 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
           and there was none to bury them.

19:079:004 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and
           derision to them that are round about us.

19:079:005 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy
           jealousy burn like fire?

19:079:006 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,
           and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

19:079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling
           place.

19:079:008 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
           mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

19:079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:
           and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

19:079:010 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him
           be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of
           the blood of thy servants which is shed.

19:079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
           the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are
           appointed to die;

19:079:012 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
           their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

19:079:013 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee
           thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all
           generations.

19:080:001 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
           a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine
           forth.

19:080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
           and come and save us.

19:080:003 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we
           shall be saved.

19:080:004 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
           prayer of thy people?

19:080:005 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them
           tears to drink in great measure.

19:080:006 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
           laugh among themselves.

19:080:007 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine;
           and we shall be saved.

19:080:008 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
           heathen, and planted it.

19:080:009 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take
           deep root, and it filled the land.

19:080:010 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
           thereof were like the goodly cedars.

19:080:011 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto
           the river.

19:080:012 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
           which pass by the way do pluck her?

19:080:013 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
           the field doth devour it.

19:080:014 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from
           heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

19:080:015 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
           branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

19:080:016 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
           rebuke of thy countenance.

19:080:017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son
           of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

19:080:018 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
           upon thy name.

19:080:019 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;
           and we shall be saved.

19:081:001 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
           God of Jacob.

19:081:002 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
           with the psaltery.

19:081:003 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
           our solemn feast day.

19:081:004 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of
           Jacob.

19:081:005 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
           through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I
           understood not.

19:081:006 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were
           delivered from the pots.

19:081:007 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered
           thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the
           waters of Meribah. Selah.

19:081:008 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
           thou wilt hearken unto me;

19:081:009 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou
           worship any strange god.

19:081:010 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
           Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

19:081:011 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
           none of me.

19:081:012 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked
           in their own counsels.

19:081:013 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
           in my ways!

19:081:014 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
           against their adversaries.

19:081:015 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
           him: but their time should have endured for ever.

19:081:016 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
           with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

19:082:001 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth
           among the gods.

19:082:002 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
           wicked? Selah.

19:082:003 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted
           and needy.

19:082:004 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
           wicked.

19:082:005 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
           darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

19:082:006 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the
           most High.

19:082:007 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

19:082:008 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
           nations.

19:083:001 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
           still, O God.

19:083:002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
           have lifted up the head.

19:083:003 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and
           consulted against thy hidden ones.

19:083:004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
           nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

19:083:005 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
           confederate against thee:
