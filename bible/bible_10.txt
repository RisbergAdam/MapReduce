22:005:010 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten
           thousand.

22:005:011 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and
           black as a raven.

22:005:012 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters,
           washed with milk, and fitly set.

22:005:013 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips
           like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

22:005:014 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is
           as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.

22:005:015 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine
           gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

22:005:016 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is
           my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

22:006:001 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?
           whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with
           thee.

22:006:002 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of
           spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

22:006:003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among
           the lilies.

22:006:004 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,
           terrible as an army with banners.

22:006:005 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy
           hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

22:006:006 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the
           washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one
           barren among them.

22:006:007 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

22:006:008 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and
           virgins without number.

22:006:009 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her
           mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The
           daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the
           concubines, and they praised her.

22:006:010 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the
           moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

22:006:011 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the
           valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the
           pomegranates budded.

22:006:012 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of
           Amminadib.

22:006:013 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look
           upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the
           company of two armies.

22:007:001 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter!
           the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the
           hands of a cunning workman.

22:007:002 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor:
           thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

22:007:003 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

22:007:004 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools
           in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the
           tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

22:007:005 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine
           head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.

22:007:006 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

22:007:007 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to
           clusters of grapes.

22:007:008 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the
           boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of
           the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;

22:007:009 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved,
           that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are
           asleep to speak.

22:007:010 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

22:007:011 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge
           in the villages.

22:007:012 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine
           flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the
           pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.

22:007:013 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of
           pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O
           my beloved.

22:008:001 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my
           mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
           yea, I should not be despised.

22:008:002 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who
           would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine
           of the juice of my pomegranate.

22:008:003 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand
           should embrace me.

22:008:004 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up,
           nor awake my love, until he please.

22:008:005 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon
           her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy
           mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that
           bare thee.

22:008:006 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm:
           for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave:
           the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most
           vehement flame.

22:008:007 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown
           it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for
           love, it would utterly be contemned.

22:008:008 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall
           we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

22:008:009 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver:
           and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of
           cedar.

22:008:010 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his
           eyes as one that found favour.

22:008:011 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard
           unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a
           thousand pieces of silver.

22:008:012 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon,
           must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof
           two hundred.

22:008:013 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to
           thy voice: cause me to hear it.

22:008:014 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a
           young hart upon the mountains of spices.

Book 23        Isaiah

23:001:001 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
           Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and
           Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

23:001:002 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath
           spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they
           have rebelled against me.

23:001:003 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but
           Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

23:001:004 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
           evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken
           the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto
           anger, they are gone away backward.

23:001:005 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and
           more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

23:001:006 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no
           soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying
           sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither
           mollified with ointment.

23:001:007 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire:
           your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is
           desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

23:001:008 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,
           as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

23:001:009 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small
           remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been
           like unto Gomorrah.

23:001:010 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
           the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

23:001:011 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
           saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and
           the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
           bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.

23:001:012 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at
           your hand, to tread my courts?

23:001:013 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto
           me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I
           cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

23:001:014 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they
           are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.

23:001:015 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
           from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:
           your hands are full of blood.

23:001:016 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings
           from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

23:001:017 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
           the fatherless, plead for the widow.

23:001:018 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though
           your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
           though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

23:001:019 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
           land:

23:001:020 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the
           sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

23:001:021 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of
           judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

23:001:022 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

23:001:023 Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every
           one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not
           the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto
           them.

23:001:024 Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of
           Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me
           of mine enemies:

23:001:025 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy
           dross, and take away all thy tin:

23:001:026 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy
           counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be
           called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

23:001:027 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
           righteousness.

23:001:028 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners
           shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be
           consumed.

23:001:029 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired,
           and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have
           chosen.

23:001:030 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden
           that hath no water.

23:001:031 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a
           spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall
           quench them.

23:002:001 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
           Jerusalem.

23:002:002 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
           of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the
           mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all
           nations shall flow unto it.

23:002:003 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to
           the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;
           and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
           paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of
           the LORD from Jerusalem.

23:002:004 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
           people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
           their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword
           against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

23:002:005 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the
           LORD.

23:002:006 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
           because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers
           like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the
           children of strangers.

23:002:007 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there
           any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses,
           neither is there any end of their chariots:

23:002:008 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of
           their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:

23:002:009 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth
           himself: therefore forgive them not.

23:002:010 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of
           the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.

23:002:011 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness
           of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be
           exalted in that day.

23:002:012 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that
           is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and
           he shall be brought low:

23:002:013 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted
           up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

23:002:014 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that
           are lifted up,

23:002:015 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,

23:002:016 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant
           pictures.

23:002:017 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
           haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall
           be exalted in that day.

23:002:018 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

23:002:019 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the
           caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of
           his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

23:002:020 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his
           idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to
           worship, to the moles and to the bats;

23:002:021 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the
           ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his
           majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

23:002:022 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for
           wherein is he to be accounted of?

23:003:001 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from
           Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole
           stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.

23:003:002 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the
           prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

23:003:003 The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the
           counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent
           orator.

23:003:004 And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall
           rule over them.

23:003:005 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and
           every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself
           proudly against the ancient, and the base against the
           honourable.

23:003:006 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
           father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let
           this ruin be under thy hand:

23:003:007 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer;
           for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a
           ruler of the people.

23:003:008 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their
           tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the
           eyes of his glory.

23:003:009 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and
           they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto
           their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

23:003:010 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for
           they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

23:003:011 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward
           of his hands shall be given him.

23:003:012 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women
           rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee
           to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

23:003:013 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the
           people.

23:003:014 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
           people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the
           vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

23:003:015 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
           faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

23:003:016 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
           haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes,
           walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with
           their feet:

23:003:017 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the
           head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover
           their secret parts.

23:003:018 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their
           tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and
           their round tires like the moon,

23:003:019 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

23:003:020 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,
           and the tablets, and the earrings,

23:003:021 The rings, and nose jewels,

23:003:022 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
           wimples, and the crisping pins,

23:003:023 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

23:003:024 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there
           shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of
           well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding
           of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.

23:003:025 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

23:003:026 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate
           shall sit upon the ground.

23:004:001 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,
           saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel:
           only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.

23:004:002 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and
           glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and
           comely for them that are escaped of Israel.

23:004:003 And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and
           he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even
           every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:

23:004:004 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the
           daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of
           Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment,
           and by the spirit of burning.

23:004:005 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount
           Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and
           the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory
           shall be a defence.

23:004:006 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time
           from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert
           from storm and from rain.

23:005:001 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved
           touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a
           very fruitful hill:

23:005:002 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and
           planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the
           midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked
           that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild
           grapes.

23:005:003 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
           I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

23:005:004 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not
           done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring
           forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?

23:005:005 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
           I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up;
           and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:

23:005:006 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
           but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command
           the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

23:005:007 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,
           and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for
           judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold
           a cry.

23:005:008 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to
           field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone
           in the midst of the earth!

23:005:009 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses
           shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

23:005:010 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed
           of an homer shall yield an ephah.

23:005:011 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
           follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine
           inflame them!

23:005:012 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine,
           are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD,
           neither consider the operation of his hands.

23:005:013 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have
           no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their
           multitude dried up with thirst.

23:005:014 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth
           without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and
           their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

23:005:015 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man
           shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

23:005:016 But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God
           that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.

23:005:017 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste
           places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

23:005:018 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin
           as it were with a cart rope:

23:005:019 That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may
           see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw
           nigh and come, that we may know it!

23:005:020 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put
           darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter
           for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

23:005:021 Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
           their own sight!

23:005:022 Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of
           strength to mingle strong drink:

23:005:023 Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
           righteousness of the righteous from him!

23:005:024 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
           consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and
           their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away
           the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the
           Holy One of Israel.

23:005:025 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,
           and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath
           smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases
           were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger
           is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

23:005:026 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and
           will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold,
           they shall come with speed swiftly:

23:005:027 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber
           nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed,
           nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:

23:005:028 Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses'
           hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a
           whirlwind:

23:005:029 Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young
           lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and
           shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.

23:005:030 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring
           of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and
           sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

23:006:001 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting
           upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the
           temple.

23:006:002 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
           twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
           and with twain he did fly.

23:006:003 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
           LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

23:006:004 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that
           cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

23:006:005 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
           unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
           lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

23:006:006 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in
           his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the
           altar:

23:006:007 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched
           thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin
           purged.

23:006:008 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,
           and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

23:006:009 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
           understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

23:006:010 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
           and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear
           with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert,
           and be healed.

23:006:011 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities
           be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and
           the land be utterly desolate,

23:006:012 And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great
           forsaking in the midst of the land.

23:006:013 But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall
           be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in
           them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be
           the substance thereof.

23:007:001 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the
           son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria,
           and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward
           Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.

23:007:002 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is
           confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the
           heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with
           the wind.

23:007:003 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz,
           thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of
           the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;

23:007:004 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither
           be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands,
           for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
           Remaliah.

23:007:005 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken
           evil counsel against thee, saying,

23:007:006 Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a
           breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even
           the son of Tabeal:

23:007:007 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it
           come to pass.

23:007:008 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is
           Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be
           broken, that it be not a people.

23:007:009 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
           Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
           established.

23:007:010 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

23:007:011 Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the
           depth, or in the height above.

23:007:012 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

23:007:013 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small
           thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

23:007:014 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a
           virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
           Immanuel.

23:007:015 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
           evil, and choose the good.

23:007:016 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose
           the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of
           both her kings.

23:007:017 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon
           thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that
           Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.

23:007:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
           hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers
           of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

23:007:019 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the
           desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all
           thorns, and upon all bushes.

23:007:020 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is
           hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of
           Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also
           consume the beard.

23:007:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall
           nourish a young cow, and two sheep;

23:007:022 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they
           shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall
           every one eat that is left in the land.

23:007:023 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall
           be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand
           silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.

23:007:024 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all
           the land shall become briers and thorns.

23:007:025 And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there
           shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it
           shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading
           of lesser cattle.

23:008:001 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and
           write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

23:008:002 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the
           priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

23:008:003 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a
           son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name
           Mahershalalhashbaz.

23:008:004 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father,
           and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
           shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

23:008:005 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

23:008:006 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that
           go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

23:008:007 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the
           waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of
           Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his
           channels, and go over all his banks:

23:008:008 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go
           over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out
           of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

23:008:009 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in
           pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird
           yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves,
           and ye shall be broken in pieces.

23:008:010 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the
           word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

23:008:011 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and
           instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this
           people, saying,

23:008:012 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people
           shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be
           afraid.

23:008:013 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear,
           and let him be your dread.

23:008:014 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling
           and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a
           gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

23:008:015 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken,
           and be snared, and be taken.

23:008:016 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

23:008:017 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the
           house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

23:008:018 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for
           signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which
           dwelleth in mount Zion.

23:008:019 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
           familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:
           should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the
           dead?

23:008:020 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
           to this word, it is because there is no light in them.

23:008:021 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and
           it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they
           shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and
           look upward.

23:008:022 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and
           darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to
           darkness.

23:009:001 Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her
           vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of
           Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more
           grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan,
           in Galilee of the nations.

23:009:002 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:
           they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
           hath the light shined.

23:009:003 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy:
           they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as
           men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

23:009:004 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of
           his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of
           Midian.

23:009:005 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
           garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and
           fuel of fire.

23:009:006 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
           government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
           called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
           Father, The Prince of Peace.

23:009:007 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no
           end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order
           it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
           henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will
           perform this.

23:009:008 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon
           Israel.

23:009:009 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant
           of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

23:009:010 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn
           stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them
           into cedars.

23:009:011 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin
           against him, and join his enemies together;

23:009:012 The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall
           devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not
           turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

23:009:013 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither
           do they seek the LORD of hosts.

23:009:014 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail,
           branch and rush, in one day.

23:009:015 The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet
           that teacheth lies, he is the tail.

23:009:016 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they
           that are led of them are destroyed.

23:009:017 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men,
           neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for
           every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth
           speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
           his hand is stretched out still.

23:009:018 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers
           and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest,
           and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

23:009:019 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened,
           and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall
           spare his brother.

23:009:020 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he
           shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied:
           they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

23:009:021 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together
           shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned
           away, but his hand is stretched out still.

23:010:001 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
           grievousness which they have prescribed;

23:010:002 To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the
           right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their
           prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!

23:010:003 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
           desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for
           help? and where will ye leave your glory?

23:010:004 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they
           shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not
           turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

23:010:005 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand
           is mine indignation.

23:010:006 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against
           the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the
           spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the
           mire of the streets.

23:010:007 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so;
           but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a
           few.

23:010:008 For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?

23:010:009 Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not
           Samaria as Damascus?

23:010:010 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose
           graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

23:010:011 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do
           to Jerusalem and her idols?

23:010:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath
           performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I
           will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
           Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

23:010:013 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and
           by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds
           of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put
           down the inhabitants like a valiant man:

23:010:014 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and
           as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the
           earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the
           mouth, or peeped.

23:010:015 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?
           or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?
           as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it
           up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no
           wood.

23:010:016 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his
           fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a
           burning like the burning of a fire.

23:010:017 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
           for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his
           briers in one day;

23:010:018 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful
           field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a
           standard-bearer fainteth.

23:010:019 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
           child may write them.

23:010:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
           Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall
           no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay
           upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

23:010:021 The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
           mighty God.

23:010:022 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
           remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall
           overflow with righteousness.

23:010:023 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even
           determined, in the midst of all the land.

23:010:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that
           dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall
           smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against
           thee, after the manner of Egypt.

23:010:025 For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,
           and mine anger in their destruction.

23:010:026 And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him
           according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and
           as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the
           manner of Egypt.

23:010:027 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall
           be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy
           neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
           anointing.

23:010:028 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he
           hath laid up his carriages:

23:010:029 They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their
           lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

23:010:030 Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard
           unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

23:010:031 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather
           themselves to flee.

23:010:032 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his
           hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of
           Jerusalem.

23:010:033 Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with
           terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and
           the haughty shall be humbled.

23:010:034 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
           and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

23:011:001 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and
           a Branch shall grow out of his roots:

23:011:002 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of
           wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
           spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;

23:011:003 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the
           LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,
           neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:

23:011:004 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove
           with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the
           earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his
           lips shall he slay the wicked.

23:011:005 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
           faithfulness the girdle of his reins.

23:011:006 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
           lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the
           fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

23:011:007 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall
           lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

23:011:008 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and
           the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

23:011:009 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for
           the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the
           waters cover the sea.

23:011:010 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
           stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles
           seek: and his rest shall be glorious.

23:011:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set
           his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his
           people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and
           from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar,
           and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

23:011:012 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
           assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the
           dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

23:011:013 The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of
           Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and
           Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

23:011:014 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines
           toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together:
           they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children
           of Ammon shall obey them.

23:011:015 And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian
           sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the
           river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men
           go over dryshod.

23:011:016 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,
           which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in
           the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

23:012:001 And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:
           though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away,
           and thou comfortedst me.

23:012:002 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid:
           for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is
           become my salvation.

23:012:003 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
           salvation.

23:012:004 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his
           name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that
           his name is exalted.

23:012:005 Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is
           known in all the earth.

23:012:006 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the
           Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.

23:013:001 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

23:013:002 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice
           unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of
           the nobles.

23:013:003 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my
           mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my
           highness.

23:013:004 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great
           people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered
           together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

23:013:005 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the
           LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole
           land.

23:013:006 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as
           a destruction from the Almighty.

23:013:007 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart
           shall melt:

23:013:008 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of
           them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they
           shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as
           flames.

23:013:009 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and
           fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy
           the sinners thereof out of it.

23:013:010 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall
           not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going
           forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

23:013:011 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for
           their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to
           cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

23:013:012 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man
           than the golden wedge of Ophir.

23:013:013 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove
           out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in
           the day of his fierce anger.

23:013:014 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
           taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and
           flee every one into his own land.

23:013:015 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one
           that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

23:013:016 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their
           eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

23:013:017 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not
           regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

23:013:018 Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they
           shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall
           not spare children.

23:013:019 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the
           Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
           Gomorrah.

23:013:020 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
           generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent
           there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

23:013:021 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their
           houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall
           dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

23:013:022 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
           houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is
           near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

23:014:001 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
           Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers
           shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house
           of Jacob.

23:014:002 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place:
           and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the
           LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them
           captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over
           their oppressors.

23:014:003 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give
           thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the
           hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,

23:014:004 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of
           Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden
           city ceased!

23:014:005 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre
           of the rulers.

23:014:006 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he
           that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none
           hindereth.

23:014:007 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth
           into singing.

23:014:008 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,
           saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against
           us.

23:014:009 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy
           coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief
           ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all
           the kings of the nations.

23:014:010 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become
           weak as we? art thou become like unto us?

23:014:011 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy
           viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover
           thee.

23:014:012 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
           morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
           weaken the nations!

23:014:013 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven,
           I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also
           upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

23:014:014 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like
           the most High.

23:014:015 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the
           pit.

23:014:016 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider
           thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble,
           that did shake kingdoms;

23:014:017 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
           thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

23:014:018 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory,
           every one in his own house.

23:014:019 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
           and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through
           with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a
           carcase trodden under feet.

23:014:020 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou
           hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of
           evildoers shall never be renowned.

23:014:021 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
           fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill
           the face of the world with cities.

23:014:022 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and
           cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and
           nephew, saith the LORD.

23:014:023 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
           water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction,
           saith the LORD of hosts.

23:014:024 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have
           thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so
           shall it stand:

23:014:025 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my
           mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart
           from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.

23:014:026 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and
           this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

23:014:027 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul
           it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

23:014:028 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

23:014:029 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that
           smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come
           forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying
           serpent.

23:014:030 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall
           lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and
           he shall slay thy remnant.

23:014:031 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art
           dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and
           none shall be alone in his appointed times.

23:014:032 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That
           the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall
           trust in it.

23:015:001 The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
           waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of
           Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;

23:015:002 He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to
           weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their
           heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.

23:015:003 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on
           the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one
           shall howl, weeping abundantly.

23:015:004 And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard
           even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall
           cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.

23:015:005 My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto
           Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of
           Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of
           Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.

23:015:006 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is
           withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.

23:015:007 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they
           have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the
           willows.

23:015:008 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the
           howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto
           Beerelim.

23:015:009 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will
           bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab,
           and upon the remnant of the land.

23:016:001 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
           wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

23:016:002 For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the
           nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

23:016:003 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night
           in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him
           that wandereth.

23:016:004 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to
           them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at
           an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out
           of the land.

23:016:005 And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit
           upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and
           seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.

23:016:006 We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of
           his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies
           shall not be so.

23:016:007 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for
           the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are
           stricken.

23:016:008 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah:
           the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants
           thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through
           the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone
           over the sea.

23:016:009 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
           Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and
           Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy
           harvest is fallen.

23:016:010 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful
           field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither
           shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine
           in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.

23:016:011 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and
           mine inward parts for Kirharesh.

23:016:012 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary
           on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to
           pray; but he shall not prevail.

23:016:013 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab
           since that time.

23:016:014 But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as
           the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be
           contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant
           shall be very small and feeble.

23:017:001 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from
           being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

23:017:002 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks,
           which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

23:017:003 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
           from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the
           glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.

23:017:004 And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob
           shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax
           lean.

23:017:005 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and
           reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that
           gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.

23:017:006 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an
           olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost
           bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof,
           saith the LORD God of Israel.

23:017:007 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall
           have respect to the Holy One of Israel.

23:017:008 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
           neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either
           the groves, or the images.

23:017:009 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough,
           and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the
           children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.

23:017:010 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast
           not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt
           thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange
           slips:

23:017:011 In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the
           morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest
           shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

23:017:012 Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like
           the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that
           make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!

23:017:013 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but
           God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall
           be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and
           like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.

23:017:014 And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he
           is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot
           of them that rob us.

23:018:001 Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the
           rivers of Ethiopia:

23:018:002 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
           bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to
           a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their
           beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose
           land the rivers have spoiled!

23:018:003 All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth,
           see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and
           when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.

23:018:004 For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
           consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs,
           and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

23:018:005 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour
           grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the
           sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the
           branches.

23:018:006 They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains,
           and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer
           upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon
           them.

23:018:007 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of
           hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people
           terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and
           trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the
           place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.

23:019:001 The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift
           cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall
           be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in
           the midst of it.

23:019:002 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
           shall fight every one against his brother, and every one
           against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against
           kingdom.

23:019:003 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I
           will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the
           idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar
           spirits, and to the wizards.

23:019:004 And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel
           lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord,
           the LORD of hosts.

23:019:005 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be
           wasted and dried up.

23:019:006 And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of
           defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags
           shall wither.

23:019:007 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and
           every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away,
           and be no more.

23:019:008 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle
           into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon
           the waters shall languish.

23:019:009 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave
           networks, shall be confounded.

23:019:010 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that
           make sluices and ponds for fish.

23:019:011 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
           counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto
           Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

23:019:012 Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee
           now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed
           upon Egypt.

23:019:013 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
           deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the
           stay of the tribes thereof.

23:019:014 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof:
           and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a
           drunken man staggereth in his vomit.

23:019:015 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or
           tail, branch or rush, may do.

23:019:016 In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be
           afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD
           of hosts, which he shaketh over it.

23:019:017 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one
           that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself,
           because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath
           determined against it.

23:019:018 In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the
           language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall
           be called, The city of destruction.

23:019:019 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst
           of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to
           the LORD.

23:019:020 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of
           hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD
           because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour,
           and a great one, and he shall deliver them.

23:019:021 And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall
           know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and
           oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform
           it.

23:019:022 And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it:
           and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be
           intreated of them, and shall heal them.

23:019:023 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
           and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into
           Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

23:019:024 In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with
           Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:

23:019:025 Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt
           my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine
           inheritance.

23:020:001 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the
           king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took
           it;

23:020:002 At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
           saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put
           off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and
           barefoot.

23:020:003 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked
           and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and
           upon Ethiopia;

23:020:004 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians
           prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked
           and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame
           of Egypt.

23:020:005 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their
           expectation, and of Egypt their glory.

23:020:006 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold,
           such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be
           delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

23:021:001 The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the
           south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a
           terrible land.

23:021:002 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer
           dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O
           Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to
           cease.

23:021:003 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold
           upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed
           down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.

23:021:004 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my
           pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.

23:021:005 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise,
           ye princes, and anoint the shield.

23:021:006 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let
           him declare what he seeth.

23:021:007 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of
           asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently
           with much heed:

23:021:008 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the
           watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole
           nights:

23:021:009 And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of
           horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is
           fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken
           unto the ground.

23:021:010 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have
           heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared
           unto you.

23:021:011 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
           what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

23:021:012 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if
           ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.

23:021:013 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye
           lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

23:021:014 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that
           was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

23:021:015 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from
           the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

23:021:016 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according
           to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall
           fail:

23:021:017 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of
           the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God
           of Israel hath spoken it.

23:022:001 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that
           thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?

23:022:002 Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city:
           thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in
           battle.

23:022:003 All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the
           archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which
           have fled from far.

23:022:004 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly,
           labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the
           daughter of my people.

23:022:005 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
           perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision,
           breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.

23:022:006 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen,
           and Kir uncovered the shield.

23:022:007 And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be
           full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in
           array at the gate.

23:022:008 And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look
           in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.

23:022:009 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they
           are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower
           pool.

23:022:010 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses
           have ye broken down to fortify the wall.

23:022:011 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of
           the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof,
           neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.

23:022:012 And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and
           to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:

23:022:013 And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep,
           eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to
           morrow we shall die.

23:022:014 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely
           this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith
           the Lord GOD of hosts.

23:022:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this
           treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,

23:022:016 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast
           hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a
           sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself
           in a rock?

23:022:017 Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity,
           and will surely cover thee.

23:022:018 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
           large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of
           thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.

23:022:019 And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state
           shall he pull thee down.

23:022:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my
           servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:

23:022:021 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with
           thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand:
           and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
           to the house of Judah.

23:022:022 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his
           shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall
           shut, and none shall open.

23:022:023 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall
           be for a glorious throne to his father's house.

23:022:024 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's
           house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small
           quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of
           flagons.

23:022:025 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is
           fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and
           fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for
           the LORD hath spoken it.

23:023:001 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
           waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the
           land of Chittim it is revealed to them.

23:023:002 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants
           of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

23:023:003 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the
           river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.

23:023:004 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the
           strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth
           children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up
           virgins.

23:023:005 As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely
           pained at the report of Tyre.

23:023:006 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.

23:023:007 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days?
           her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.

23:023:008 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,
           whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the
           honourable of the earth?

23:023:009 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all
           glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the
           earth.

23:023:010 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish:
           there is no more strength.

23:023:011 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:
           the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city,
           to destroy the strong holds thereof.

23:023:012 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed
           virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there
           also shalt thou have no rest.

23:023:013 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till
           the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness:
           they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces
           thereof; and he brought it to ruin.

23:023:014 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.

23:023:015 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be
           forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king:
           after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.

23:023:016 Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
           forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou
           mayest be remembered.

23:023:017 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that
           the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and
           shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world
           upon the face of the earth.

23:023:018 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the
           LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her
           merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to
           eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

23:024:001 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,
           and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the
           inhabitants thereof.

23:024:002 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as
           with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so
           with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as
           with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of
           usury, so with the giver of usury to him.

23:024:003 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for
           the LORD hath spoken this word.

23:024:004 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
           fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.

23:024:005 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
           because they have transgressed the laws, changed the
           ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

23:024:006 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that
           dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the
           earth are burned, and few men left.

23:024:007 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the
           merryhearted do sigh.

23:024:008 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
           endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

23:024:009 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
           bitter to them that drink it.

23:024:010 The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up,
           that no man may come in.

23:024:011 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is
           darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.

23:024:012 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
           destruction.

23:024:013 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the
           people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as
           the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.

23:024:014 They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the
           majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

23:024:015 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of
           the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.

23:024:016 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even
           glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness,
           woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously;
           yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

23:024:017 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant
           of the earth.

23:024:018 And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise
           of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out
           of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the
           windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the
           earth do shake.

23:024:019 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean
           dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.

23:024:020 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be
           removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be
           heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

23:024:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
           punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the
           kings of the earth upon the earth.

23:024:022 And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
           in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many
           days shall they be visited.

23:024:023 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when
           the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,
           and before his ancients gloriously.

23:025:001 O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
           name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old
           are faithfulness and truth.

23:025:002 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a
           ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be
           built.

23:025:003 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of
           the terrible nations shall fear thee.

23:025:004 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
           needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from
           the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm
           against the wall.

23:025:005 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a
           dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the
           branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.

23:025:006 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all
           people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of
           fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

23:025:007 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
           cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all
           nations.

23:025:008 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will
           wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his
           people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD
           hath spoken it.

23:025:009 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
           waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have
           waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

23:025:010 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab
           shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down
           for the dunghill.

23:025:011 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as
           he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he
           shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their
           hands.

23:025:012 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring
           down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

23:026:001 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We
           have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and
           bulwarks.

23:026:002 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the
           truth may enter in.

23:026:003 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
           thee: because he trusteth in thee.

23:026:004 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
           everlasting strength:

23:026:005 For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city,
           he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he
           bringeth it even to the dust.

23:026:006 The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and
           the steps of the needy.

23:026:007 The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost
           weigh the path of the just.

23:026:008 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
           thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the
           remembrance of thee.

23:026:009 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
           spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy
           judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will
           learn righteousness.

23:026:010 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
           righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal
           unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.

23:026:011 LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
           shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea,
           the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.

23:026:012 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast
           wrought all our works in us.

23:026:013 O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over
           us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

23:026:014 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they
           shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed
           them, and made all their memory to perish.

23:026:015 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased
           the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto
           all the ends of the earth.

23:026:016 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a
           prayer when thy chastening was upon them.

23:026:017 Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
           delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we
           been in thy sight, O LORD.

23:026:018 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it
           were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance
           in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world
           fallen.

23:026:019 Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
           arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is
           as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

23:026:020 Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
           doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment,
           until the indignation be overpast.

23:026:021 For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
           inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also
           shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

23:027:001 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword
           shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan
           that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in
           the sea.

23:027:002 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.

23:027:003 I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
           hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

23:027:004 Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against
           me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them
           together.

23:027:005 Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace
           with me; and he shall make peace with me.

23:027:006 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel
           shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with
           fruit.

23:027:007 Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is
           he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by
           him?

23:027:008 In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it:
           he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

23:027:009 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and
           this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all
           the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in
           sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.

23:027:010 Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
           forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf
           feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches
           thereof.

23:027:011 When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken
           off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people
           of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have
           mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no
           favour.

23:027:012 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
           beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of
           Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of
           Israel.

23:027:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet
           shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish
           in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
           and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.

23:028:001 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
           glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of
           the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!

23:028:002 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a
           tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty
           waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the
           hand.

23:028:003 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden
           under feet:

23:028:004 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat
           valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit
           before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth,
           while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.

23:028:005 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory,
           and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,

23:028:006 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment,
           and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.

23:028:007 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong
           drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have
           erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine,
           they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in
           vision, they stumble in judgment.

23:028:008 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there
           is no place clean.

23:028:009 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
           understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and
           drawn from the breasts.

23:028:010 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
           upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:

23:028:011 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to
           this people.

23:028:012 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
           weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not
           hear.

23:028:013 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
           precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a
           little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall
           backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

23:028:014 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that
           rule this people which is in Jerusalem.

23:028:015 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and
           with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge
           shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have
           made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid
           ourselves:

23:028:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
           foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a
           sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.

23:028:017 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
           plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and
           the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

23:028:018 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
           agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing
           scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by
           it.

23:028:019 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for
           morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night:
           and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.

23:028:020 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
           it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in
           it.

23:028:021 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
           wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his
           strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

23:028:022 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made
           strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a
           consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.

23:028:023 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

23:028:024 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break
           the clods of his ground?

23:028:025 When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast
           abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the
           principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their
           place?

23:028:026 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach
           him.

23:028:027 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
           neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the
           fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a
           rod.

23:028:028 Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing
           it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it
           with his horsemen.

23:028:029 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is
           wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

23:029:001 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye
           year to year; let them kill sacrifices.

23:029:002 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and
           sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.

23:029:003 And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege
           against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against
           thee.

23:029:004 And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the
           ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy
           voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of
           the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.

23:029:005 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small
           dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff
           that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.

23:029:006 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and
           with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and
           the flame of devouring fire.

23:029:007 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
           even all that fight against her and her munition, and that
           distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.

23:029:008 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold,
           he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a
           thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he
           awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite:
           so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight
           against mount Zion.

23:029:009 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
           drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong
           drink.

23:029:010 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
           sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your
           rulers, the seers hath he covered.

23:029:011 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a
           book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned,
           saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it
           is sealed:

23:029:012 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying,
           Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

23:029:013 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me
           with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have
           removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is
           taught by the precept of men:

23:029:014 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work
           among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for
           the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the
           understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.

23:029:015 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
           LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth
           us? and who knoweth us?

23:029:016 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as
           the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it,
           He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that
           framed it, He had no understanding?

23:029:017 Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned
           into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be
           esteemed as a forest?

23:029:018 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and
           the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of
           darkness.

23:029:019 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the
           poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

23:029:020 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
           consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:

23:029:021 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for
           him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a
           thing of nought.

23:029:022 Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham,
           concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed,
           neither shall his face now wax pale.

23:029:023 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the
           midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the
           Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

23:029:024 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,
           and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.

23:030:001 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take
           counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but
           not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:

23:030:002 That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my
           mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
           and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

23:030:003 Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the
           trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

23:030:004 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to
           Hanes.

23:030:005 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them,
           nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

23:030:006 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of
           trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion,
           the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their
           riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures
           upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit
           them.

23:030:007 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
           therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to
           sit still.

23:030:008 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a
           book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

23:030:009 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children
           that will not hear the law of the LORD:

23:030:010 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy
           not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things,
           prophesy deceits:

23:030:011 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the
           Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

23:030:012 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye
           despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness,
           and stay thereon:

23:030:013 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
           fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh
           suddenly at an instant.

23:030:014 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel
           that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there
           shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire
           from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.

23:030:015 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In
           returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in
           confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.

23:030:016 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall
           ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall
           they that pursue you be swift.

23:030:017 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
           five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top
           of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.

23:030:018 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
           you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy
           upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all
           they that wait for him.

23:030:019 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt
           weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice
           of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.

23:030:020 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
           water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed
           into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

23:030:021 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is
           the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and
           when ye turn to the left.

23:030:022 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
           silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou
           shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say
           unto it, Get thee hence.

23:030:023 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow
           the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and
           it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle
           feed in large pastures.

23:030:024 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground
           shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the
           shovel and with the fan.

23:030:025 And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every
           high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the
           great slaughter, when the towers fall.

23:030:026 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the
           sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light
           of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach
           of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.

23:030:027 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
           anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of
           indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

23:030:028 And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the
           midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of
           vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people,
           causing them to err.

23:030:029 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
           kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to
           come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of
           Israel.

23:030:030 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and
           shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation
           of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with
           scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.

23:030:031 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
           down, which smote with a rod.

23:030:032 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
           the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and
           harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

23:030:033 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is
           prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is
           fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of
           brimstone, doth kindle it.

23:031:001 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on
           horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in
           horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto
           the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!

23:031:002 Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call
           back his words: but will arise against the house of the
           evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.

23:031:003 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses
           flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his
           hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen
           shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.

23:031:004 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and
           the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of
           shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid
           of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so
           shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and
           for the hill thereof.

23:031:005 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
           defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will
           preserve it.

23:031:006 Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
           revolted.

23:031:007 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver,
           and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you
           for a sin.

23:031:008 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty
           man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but
           he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be
           discomfited.

23:031:009 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
           princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose
           fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

23:032:001 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
           rule in judgment.

23:032:002 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a
           covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as
           the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

23:032:003 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears
           of them that hear shall hearken.

23:032:004 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the
           tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

23:032:005 The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl
           said to be bountiful.

23:032:006 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will
           work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error
           against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he
           will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

23:032:007 The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
           devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the
           needy speaketh right.

23:032:008 But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things
           shall he stand.

23:032:009 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
           daughters; give ear unto my speech.

23:032:010 Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women:
           for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

23:032:011 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
           ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon
           your loins.

23:032:012 They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for
           the fruitful vine.

23:032:013 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers;
           yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:

23:032:014 Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the
           city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for
           ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

23:032:015 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the
           wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be
           counted for a forest.

23:032:016 Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
           remain in the fruitful field.

23:032:017 And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect
           of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

23:032:018 And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in
           sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;

23:032:019 When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city
           shall be low in a low place.

23:032:020 Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
           thither the feet of the ox and the ass.

23:033:001 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and
           dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with
           thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled;
           and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they
           shall deal treacherously with thee.

23:033:002 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
           their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of
           trouble.

23:033:003 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up
           of thyself the nations were scattered.

23:033:004 And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
           caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run
           upon them.

23:033:005 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled
           Zion with judgment and righteousness.

23:033:006 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,
           and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his
           treasure.

23:033:007 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors
           of peace shall weep bitterly.

23:033:008 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath
           broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth
           no man.

23:033:009 The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and
           hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel
           shake off their fruits.

23:033:010 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now
           will I lift up myself.

23:033:011 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your
           breath, as fire, shall devour you.

23:033:012 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut
           up shall they be burned in the fire.

23:033:013 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are
           near, acknowledge my might.

23:033:014 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
           hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
           who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

23:033:015 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that
           despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from
           holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of
           blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

23:033:016 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the
           munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall
           be sure.

23:033:017 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold
           the land that is very far off.

23:033:018 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where
           is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?

23:033:019 Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper
           speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that
           thou canst not understand.

23:033:020 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall
           see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not
           be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
           removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

23:033:021 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad
           rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars,
           neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

23:033:022 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD
           is our king; he will save us.

23:033:023 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
           mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a
           great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

23:033:024 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that
           dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.

23:034:001 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let
           the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all
           things that come forth of it.

23:034:002 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his
           fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he
           hath delivered them to the slaughter.

23:034:003 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come
           up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted
           with their blood.

23:034:004 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens
           shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall
           fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a
           falling fig from the fig tree.

23:034:005 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come
           down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to
           judgment.

23:034:006 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat
           with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the
           fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in
           Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.

23:034:007 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks
           with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and
           their dust made fat with fatness.

23:034:008 For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of
           recompences for the controversy of Zion.

23:034:009 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the
           dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become
           burning pitch.

23:034:010 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof
           shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall
           lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.

23:034:011 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl
           also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out
           upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

23:034:012 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
           shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

23:034:013 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles
           in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of
           dragons, and a court for owls.

23:034:014 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
           beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow;
           the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a
           place of rest.

23:034:015 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch,
           and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be
           gathered, every one with her mate.

23:034:016 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these
           shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath
           commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.

23:034:017 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided
           it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from
           generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

23:035:001 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;
           and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

23:035:002 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
           singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the
           excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of
           the LORD, and the excellency of our God.

23:035:003 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

23:035:004 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
           behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a
           recompence; he will come and save you.

23:035:005 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of
           the deaf shall be unstopped.

23:035:006 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
           dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and
           streams in the desert.

23:035:007 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty
           land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where
           each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.

23:035:008 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be
           called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over
           it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though
           fools, shall not err therein.

23:035:009 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up
           thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall
           walk there:

23:035:010 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion
           with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall
           obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
           away.

23:036:001 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
           that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the
           defenced cities of Judah, and took them.

23:036:002 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to
           Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood
           by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the
           fuller's field.

23:036:003 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was
           over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son,
           the recorder.

23:036:004 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
           saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
           this wherein thou trustest?

23:036:005 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have
           counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust,
           that thou rebellest against me?

23:036:006 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt;
           whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce
           it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.

23:036:007 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not
           he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken
           away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship
           before this altar?

23:036:008 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king
           of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou
           be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

23:036:009 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
           least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
           chariots and for horsemen?

23:036:010 And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to
           destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land,
           and destroy it.

23:036:011 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
           pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we
           understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in
           the ears of the people that are on the wall.

23:036:012 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and
           to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men
           that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and
           drink their own piss with you?

23:036:013 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
           language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the
           king of Assyria.

23:036:014 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
           shall not be able to deliver you.

23:036:015 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
           LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered
           into the hand of the king of Assyria.

23:036:016 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
           Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me:
           and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig
           tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;

23:036:017 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
           land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

23:036:018 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will
           deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his
           land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

23:036:019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of
           Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

23:036:020 Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have
           delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should
           deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

23:036:021 But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for
           the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

23:036:022 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
           household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph,
           the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
           him the words of Rabshakeh.

23:037:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
           his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
           the house of the LORD.

23:037:002 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna
           the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with
           sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

23:037:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
           of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children
           are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring
           forth.

23:037:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
           whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the
           living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God
           hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
           is left.

23:037:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

23:037:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,
           Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast
           heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have
           blasphemed me.

23:037:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
           rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to
           fall by the sword in his own land.

23:037:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
           against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
           Lachish.

23:037:009 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is
           come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he
           sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

23:037:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
           thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying,
           Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
           Assyria.

23:037:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
           all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be
           delivered?

23:037:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
           have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
           children of Eden which were in Telassar?

23:037:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the
           king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

23:037:014 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the
           messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house
           of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

23:037:015 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,

23:037:016 O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the
           cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the
           kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

23:037:017 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,
           and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath
           sent to reproach the living God.

23:037:018 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
           nations, and their countries,

23:037:019 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
           but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
           have destroyed them.

23:037:020 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all
           the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD,
           even thou only.

23:037:021 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
           saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me
           against Sennacherib king of Assyria:

23:037:022 This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him;
           The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and
           laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken
           her head at thee.

23:037:023 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
           hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
           even against the Holy One of Israel.

23:037:024 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said,
           By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of
           the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down
           the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and
           I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of
           his Carmel.

23:037:025 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
           have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

23:037:026 Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of
           ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
           pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into
           ruinous heaps.

23:037:027 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
           dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field,
           and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as
           corn blasted before it be grown up.

23:037:028 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
           and thy rage against me.

23:037:029 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into
           mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my
           bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
           which thou camest.

23:037:030 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
           such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which
           springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap,
           and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.

23:037:031 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
           again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

23:037:032 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
           escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
           do this.

23:037:033 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
           He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
           nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

23:037:034 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
           shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

23:037:035 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and
           for my servant David's sake.

23:037:036 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp
           of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand:
           and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were
           all dead corpses.

23:037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
           returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

23:037:038 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
           Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
           him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia:
           and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

23:038:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the
           prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus
           saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die,
           and not live.

23:038:002 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto
           the LORD,

23:038:003 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have
           walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have
           done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

23:038:004 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,

23:038:005 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David
           thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears:
           behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

23:038:006 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the
           king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.

23:038:007 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the
           LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;

23:038:008 Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is
           gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So
           the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone
           down.

23:038:009 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,
           and was recovered of his sickness:

23:038:010 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates
           of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.

23:038:011 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land
           of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants
           of the world.

23:038:012 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's
           tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off
           with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an
           end of me.

23:038:013 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all
           my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

23:038:014 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
           dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am
           oppressed; undertake for me.

23:038:015 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself
           hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness
           of my soul.

23:038:016 O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is
           the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to
           live.

23:038:017 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in
           love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for
           thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.

23:038:018 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate
           thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy
           truth.

23:038:019 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this
           day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

23:038:020 The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
           to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the
           house of the LORD.

23:038:021 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
           for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

23:038:022 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to
           the house of the LORD?

23:039:001 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
           Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had
           heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.

23:039:002 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of
           his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices,
           and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour,
           and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in
           his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them
           not.

23:039:003 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
           him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
           And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me,
           even from Babylon.

23:039:004 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
           answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is
           nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

23:039:005 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of
           hosts:

23:039:006 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
           that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day,
           shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the
           LORD.

23:039:007 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
           beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
           palace of the king of Babylon.

23:039:008 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
           which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be
           peace and truth in my days.

23:040:001 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

23:040:002 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
           warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for
           she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.

23:040:003 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
           way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our
           God.

23:040:004 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill
           shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and
           the rough places plain:

23:040:005 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh
           shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
           it.

23:040:006 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh
           is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of
           the field:

23:040:007 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of
           the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.

23:040:008 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our
           God shall stand for ever.

23:040:009 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
           mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy
           voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the
           cities of Judah, Behold your God!

23:040:010 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm
           shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his
           work before him.

23:040:011 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
           lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall
           gently lead those that are with young.

23:040:012 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and
           meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of
           the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
           and the hills in a balance?

23:040:013 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his
           counsellor hath taught him?

23:040:014 With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught
           him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and
           shewed to him the way of understanding?

23:040:015 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
           as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the
           isles as a very little thing.

23:040:016 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
           sufficient for a burnt offering.

23:040:017 All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to
           him less than nothing, and vanity.

23:040:018 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye
           compare unto him?

23:040:019 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith
           spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

23:040:020 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
           tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman
           to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.

23:040:021 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told
           you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the
           foundations of the earth?

23:040:022 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
           inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out
           the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to
           dwell in:

23:040:023 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of
           the earth as vanity.

23:040:024 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
           yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he
           shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the
           whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

23:040:025 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the
           Holy One.

23:040:026 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
           things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth
           them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he
           is strong in power; not one faileth.

23:040:027 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is
           hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?

23:040:028 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting
           God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth
           not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his
           understanding.

23:040:029 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
           he increaseth strength.

23:040:030 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men
           shall utterly fall:

23:040:031 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength;
           they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and
           not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

23:041:001 Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew
           their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let
           us come near together to judgment.

23:041:002 Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to
           his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over
           kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven
           stubble to his bow.

23:041:003 He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he
           had not gone with his feet.

23:041:004 Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the
           beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.

23:041:005 The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were
           afraid, drew near, and came.

23:041:006 They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his
           brother, Be of good courage.

23:041:007 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that
           smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It
           is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that
           it should not be moved.

23:041:008 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
           the seed of Abraham my friend.

23:041:009 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called
           thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art
           my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

23:041:010 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am
           thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I
           will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

23:041:011 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be
           ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they
           that strive with thee shall perish.

23:041:012 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that
           contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as
           nothing, and as a thing of nought.

23:041:013 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto
           thee, Fear not; I will help thee.

23:041:014 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help
           thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of
           Israel.

23:041:015 Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument
           having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them
           small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.

23:041:016 Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and
           the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in
           the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.

23:041:017 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and
           their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I
           the God of Israel will not forsake them.

23:041:018 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst
           of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
           and the dry land springs of water.

23:041:019 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree,
           and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the
           fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:

23:041:020 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand
           together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the
           Holy One of Israel hath created it.

23:041:021 Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong
           reasons, saith the King of Jacob.

23:041:022 Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let
           them shew the former things, what they be, that we may
           consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us
           things for to come.

23:041:023 Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know
           that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be
           dismayed, and behold it together.

23:041:024 Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an
           abomination is he that chooseth you.

23:041:025 I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from
           the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall
           come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth
           clay.

23:041:026 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and
           beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is
           none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea,
           there is none that heareth your words.

23:041:027 The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will
           give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.

23:041:028 For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there
           was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a
           word.

23:041:029 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their
           molten images are wind and confusion.

23:042:001 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
           delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring
           forth judgment to the Gentiles.

23:042:002 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard
           in the street.

23:042:003 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall
           he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

23:042:004 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set
           judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

23:042:005 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and
           stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that
           which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people
           upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

23:042:006 I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold
           thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant
           of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

23:042:007 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
           prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

23:042:008 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give
           to another, neither my praise to graven images.

23:042:009 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do
           I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

23:042:010 Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of
           the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is
           therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

23:042:011 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,
           the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of
           the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

23:042:012 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in
           the islands.

23:042:013 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up
           jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall
           prevail against his enemies.

23:042:014 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and
           refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I
           will destroy and devour at once.

23:042:015 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their
           herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up
           the pools.

23:042:016 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
           lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make
           darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These
           things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

23:042:017 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that
           trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are
           our gods.

23:042:018 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

23:042:019 Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I
           sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the
           LORD's servant?

23:042:020 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears,
           but he heareth not.

23:042:021 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will
           magnify the law, and make it honourable.

23:042:022 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them
           snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are
           for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith,
           Restore.

23:042:023 Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
           for the time to come?

23:042:024 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not
           the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not
           walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

23:042:025 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and
           the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round
           about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not
           to heart.

23:043:001 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he
           that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed
           thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.

23:043:002 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
           through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou
           walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
           shall the flame kindle upon thee.

23:043:003 For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
           Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for
           thee.

23:043:004 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been
           honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men
           for thee, and people for thy life.

23:043:005 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the
           east, and gather thee from the west;

23:043:006 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not
           back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends
           of the earth;

23:043:007 Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created
           him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

23:043:008 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that
           have ears.

23:043:009 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people
           be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us
           former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they
           may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.

23:043:010 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I
           have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand
           that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall
           there be after me.

23:043:011 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.

23:043:012 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there
           was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses,
           saith the LORD, that I am God.

23:043:013 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
           deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

23:043:014 Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
           For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down
           all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the
           ships.

23:043:015 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your
           King.

23:043:016 Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path
           in the mighty waters;

23:043:017 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the
           power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they
           are extinct, they are quenched as tow.

23:043:018 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things
           of old.

23:043:019 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth;
           shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the
           wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

23:043:020 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the
           owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in
           the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.

23:043:021 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
           praise.

23:043:022 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
           weary of me, O Israel.

23:043:023 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt
           offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices.
           I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied
           thee with incense.

23:043:024 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast
           thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast
           made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with
           thine iniquities.

23:043:025 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
           own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

23:043:026 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou,
           that thou mayest be justified.

23:043:027 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have
           transgressed against me.

23:043:028 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and
           have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

23:044:001 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have
           chosen:

23:044:002 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
           womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and
           thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

23:044:003 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
           upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and
           my blessing upon thine offspring:

23:044:004 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the
           water courses.

23:044:005 One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself
           by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his
           hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.

23:044:006 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
           LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside
           me there is no God.

23:044:007 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in
           order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the
           things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto
           them.

23:044:008 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
           time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there
           a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.

23:044:009 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and
           their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their
           own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be
           ashamed.

23:044:010 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is
           profitable for nothing?

23:044:011 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen,
           they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them
           stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed
           together.

23:044:012 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and
           fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength
           of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he
           drinketh no water, and is faint.

23:044:013 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with
           a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with
           the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man,
           according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the
           house.

23:044:014 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
           which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the
           forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.

23:044:015 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof,
           and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea,
           he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven
           image, and falleth down thereto.

23:044:016 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he
           eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he
           warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the
           fire:

23:044:017 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven
           image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and
           prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.

23:044:018 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their
           eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot
           understand.

23:044:019 And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge
           nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the
           fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I
           have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue
           thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a
           tree?

23:044:020 He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside,
           that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie
           in my right hand?

23:044:021 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I
           have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt
           not be forgotten of me.

23:044:022 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
           as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed
           thee.

23:044:023 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower
           parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O
           forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed
           Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

23:044:024 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee
           from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that
           stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the
           earth by myself;

23:044:025 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners
           mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their
           knowledge foolish;

23:044:026 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the
           counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt
           be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built,
           and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

23:044:027 That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

23:044:028 That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all
           my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built;
           and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

23:045:001 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right
           hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will
           loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved
           gates; and the gates shall not be shut;

23:045:002 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I
           will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the
           bars of iron:

23:045:003 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden
           riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the
           LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.

23:045:004 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have
           even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though
           thou hast not known me.

23:045:005 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside
           me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

23:045:006 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the
           west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there
           is none else.

23:045:007 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and
           create evil: I the LORD do all these things.

23:045:008 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
           righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth
           salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the
           LORD have created it.

23:045:009 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd
           strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to
           him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath
           no hands?

23:045:010 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?
           or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?

23:045:011 Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker,
           Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning
           the work of my hands command ye me.

23:045:012 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my
           hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have
           I commanded.

23:045:013 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all
           his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my
           captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.

23:045:014 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of
           Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over
           unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after
           thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down
           unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying,
           Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no
           God.

23:045:015 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,
           the Saviour.

23:045:016 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they
           shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.

23:045:017 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
           salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world
           without end.

23:045:018 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself
           that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he
           created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the
           LORD; and there is none else.

23:045:019 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
           said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the
           LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

23:045:020 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are
           escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the
           wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot
           save.

23:045:021 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel
           together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath
           told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no
           God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none
           beside me.

23:045:022 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for
           I am God, and there is none else.

23:045:023 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
           righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee
           shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

23:045:024 Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
           strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are
           incensed against him shall be ashamed.

23:045:025 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and
           shall glory.

23:046:001 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the
           beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden;
           they are a burden to the weary beast.

23:046:002 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
           burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

23:046:003 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the
           house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which
           are carried from the womb:

23:046:004 And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will
           I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry,
           and will deliver you.

23:046:005 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me,
           that we may be like?

23:046:006 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the
           balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they
           fall down, yea, they worship.

23:046:007 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him
           in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not
           remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer,
           nor save him out of his trouble.

23:046:008 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to
           mind, O ye transgressors.

23:046:009 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is
           none else; I am God, and there is none like me,

23:046:010 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
           the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall
           stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

23:046:011 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth
           my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will
           also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.

23:046:012 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from
           righteousness:

23:046:013 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my
           salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion
           for Israel my glory.

23:047:001 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,
           sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the
           Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and
           delicate.

23:047:002 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make
           bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

23:047:003 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be
           seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a
           man.

23:047:004 As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy
           One of Israel.

23:047:005 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the
           Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of
           kingdoms.

23:047:006 I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance,
           and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy;
           upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

23:047:007 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou
           didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst
           remember the latter end of it.

23:047:008 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures,
           that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am,
           and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither
           shall I know the loss of children:

23:047:009 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one
           day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon
           thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries,
           and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.

23:047:010 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None
           seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted
           thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else
           beside me.

23:047:011 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from
           whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou
           shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come
           upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.

23:047:012 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of
           thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if
           so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest
           prevail.

23:047:013 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
           astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
           stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon
           thee.

23:047:014 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
           they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
           there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before
           it.

23:047:015 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured,
           even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every
           one to his quarter; none shall save thee.

23:048:001 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name
           of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah,
           which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the
           God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.

23:048:002 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
           upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.

23:048:003 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they
           went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them
           suddenly, and they came to pass.

23:048:004 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an
           iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

23:048:005 I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it
           came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine
           idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image,
           hath commanded them.

23:048:006 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I
           have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden
           things, and thou didst not know them.

23:048:007 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before
           the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say,
           Behold, I knew them.

23:048:008 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
           time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou
           wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a
           transgressor from the womb.

23:048:009 For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
           will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.

23:048:010 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have
           chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.

23:048:011 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for
           how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory
           unto another.

23:048:012 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am
           the first, I also am the last.

23:048:013 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my
           right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them,
           they stand up together.

23:048:014 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath
           declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his
           pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

23:048:015 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought
           him, and he shall make his way prosperous.

23:048:016 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in
           secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am
           I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

23:048:017 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I
           am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which
           leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.

23:048:018 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
           peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of
           the sea:

23:048:019 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
           bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been
           cut off nor destroyed from before me.

23:048:020 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a
           voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the
           end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant
           Jacob.

23:048:021 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he
           caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave
           the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

23:048:022 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.

23:049:001 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;
           The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
           mother hath he made mention of my name.

23:049:002 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
           his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his
           quiver hath he hid me;

23:049:003 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I
           will be glorified.

23:049:004 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
           for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the
           LORD, and my work with my God.

23:049:005 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
           servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not
           gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and
           my God shall be my strength.

23:049:006 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
           servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the
           preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the
           Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the
           earth.

23:049:007 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,
           to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth,
           to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes
           also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and
           the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.

23:049:008 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee,
           and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will
           preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to
           establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
           heritages;

23:049:009 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that
           are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways,
           and their pastures shall be in all high places.

23:049:010 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
           sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead
           them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.

23:049:011 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall
           be exalted.

23:049:012 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the
           north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

23:049:013 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
           singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people,
           and will have mercy upon his afflicted.

23:049:014 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
           forgotten me.

23:049:015 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
           compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet
           will I not forget thee.

23:049:016 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy
           walls are continually before me.

23:049:017 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that
           made thee waste shall go forth of thee.

23:049:018 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather
           themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the
           LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an
           ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.

23:049:019 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
           destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the
           inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far
           away.

23:049:020 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the
           other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait
           for me: give place to me that I may dwell.

23:049:021 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me
           these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a
           captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up
           these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?

23:049:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to
           the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they
           shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be
           carried upon their shoulders.

23:049:023 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
           nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face
           toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou
           shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed
           that wait for me.

23:049:024 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
           delivered?

23:049:025 But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall
           be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be
           delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with
           thee, and I will save thy children.

23:049:026 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh;
           and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet
           wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour
           and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

23:050:001 Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's
           divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is
           it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have
           ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother
           put away.

23:050:002 Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was
           there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it
           cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my
           rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their
           fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for
           thirst.

23:050:003 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
           their covering.

23:050:004 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
           should know how to speak a word in season to him that is
           weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to
           hear as the learned.

23:050:005 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
           neither turned away back.

23:050:006 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that
           plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and
           spitting.

23:050:007 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be
           confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I
           know that I shall not be ashamed.

23:050:008 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let
           us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to
           me.

23:050:009 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall
           condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth
           shall eat them up.

23:050:010 Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
           of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?
           let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.

23:050:011 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves
           about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the
           sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand;
           ye shall lie down in sorrow.

23:051:001 Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that
           seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to
           the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.

23:051:002 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you:
           for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

23:051:003 For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste
           places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her
           desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be
           found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

23:051:004 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation:
           for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment
           to rest for a light of the people.

23:051:005 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
           arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and
           on mine arm shall they trust.

23:051:006 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
           beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the
           earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell
           therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be
           for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

23:051:007 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in
           whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men,
           neither be ye afraid of their revilings.

23:051:008 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
           shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for
           ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.

23:051:009 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in
           the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it
           that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

23:051:010 Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the
           great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the
           ransomed to pass over?

23:051:011 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with
           singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their
           head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and
           mourning shall flee away.

23:051:012 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
           shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of
           man which shall be made as grass;

23:051:013 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth
           the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast
           feared continually every day because of the fury of the
           oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the
           fury of the oppressor?

23:051:014 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he
           should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

23:051:015 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
           roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.

23:051:016 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee
           in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and
           lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art
           my people.

23:051:017 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
           hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the
           dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.

23:051:018 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath
           brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the
           hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.

23:051:019 These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for
           thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the
           sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?

23:051:020 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the
           streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of
           the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.

23:051:021 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not
           with wine:

23:051:022 Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the
           cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand
           the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury;
           thou shalt no more drink it again:

23:051:023 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee;
           which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over:
           and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street,
           to them that went over.

23:052:001 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy
           beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth
           there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the
           unclean.

23:052:002 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem:
           loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter
           of Zion.

23:052:003 For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought;
           and ye shall be redeemed without money.

23:052:004 For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime
           into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them
           without cause.

23:052:005 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my
           people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make
           them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every
           day is blasphemed.

23:052:006 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall
           know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is
           I.

23:052:007 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
           bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth
           good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith
           unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

23:052:008 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together
           shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD
           shall bring again Zion.

23:052:009 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
           Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath
           redeemed Jerusalem.

23:052:010 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
           nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation
           of our God.

23:052:011 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean
           thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear
           the vessels of the LORD.

23:052:012 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the
           LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your
           rereward.

23:052:013 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted
           and extolled, and be very high.

23:052:014 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more
           than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

23:052:015 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their
           mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall
           they see; and that which they had not heard shall they
           consider.

23:053:001 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the
           LORD revealed?

23:053:002 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a
           root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
           when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should
           desire him.

23:053:003 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
           acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from
           him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

23:053:004 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet
           we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

23:053:005 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
           our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
           and with his stripes we are healed.

23:053:006 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
           to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of
           us all.

23:053:007 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
           mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
           sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his
           mouth.

23:053:008 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall
           declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of
           the living: for the transgression of my people was he
           stricken.

23:053:009 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in
           his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any
           deceit in his mouth.

23:053:010 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to
           grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he
           shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the
           pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.

23:053:011 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
           satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify
           many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

23:053:012 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
           shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured
           out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the
           transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made
           intercession for the transgressors.

23:054:001 Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into
           singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with
           child: for more are the children of the desolate than the
           children of the married wife, saith the LORD.

23:054:002 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the
           curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords,
           and strengthen thy stakes;

23:054:003 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left;
           and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate
           cities to be inhabited.

23:054:004 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou
           confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt
           forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the
           reproach of thy widowhood any more.

23:054:005 For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name;
           and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole
           earth shall he be called.

23:054:006 For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved
           in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith
           thy God.

23:054:007 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great
           mercies will I gather thee.

23:054:008 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but
           with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the
           LORD thy Redeemer.

23:054:009 For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn
           that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so
           have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke
           thee.

23:054:010 For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but
           my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the
           covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath
           mercy on thee.

23:054:011 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,
           behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy
           foundations with sapphires.

23:054:012 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
           carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

23:054:013 And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great
           shall be the peace of thy children.

23:054:014 In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far
           from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for
           it shall not come near thee.

23:054:015 Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me:
           whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for
           thy sake.

23:054:016 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
           fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and
           I have created the waster to destroy.

23:054:017 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every
           tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt
           condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and
           their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.

23:055:001 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he
           that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine
           and milk without money and without price.

23:055:002 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and
           your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently
           unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul
           delight itself in fatness.

23:055:003 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall
           live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even
           the sure mercies of David.

23:055:004 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader
           and commander to the people.

23:055:005 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and
           nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the
           LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath
           glorified thee.

23:055:006 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while
           he is near:

23:055:007 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
           thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have
           mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

23:055:008 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
           my ways, saith the LORD.

23:055:009 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
           higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

23:055:010 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
           returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it
           bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and
           bread to the eater:

23:055:011 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall
           not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I
           please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

23:055:012 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the
           mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into
           singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their
           hands.

23:055:013 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead
           of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to
           the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be
           cut off.

23:056:001 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
           salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be
           revealed.

23:056:002 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
           layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,
           and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.

23:056:003 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself
           to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me
           from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a
           dry tree.

23:056:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my
           sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold
           of my covenant;

23:056:005 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a
           place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will
           give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.

23:056:006 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the
           LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be
           his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from
           polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;

23:056:007 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them
           joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their
           sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house
           shall be called an house of prayer for all people.

23:056:008 The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith,
           Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are
           gathered unto him.

23:056:009 All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts
           in the forest.

23:056:010 His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all
           dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to
           slumber.

23:056:011 Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and
           they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to
           their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.

23:056:012 Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill
           ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this
           day, and much more abundant.

23:057:001 The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and
           merciful men are taken away, none considering that the
           righteous is taken away from the evil to come.

23:057:002 He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each
           one walking in his uprightness.

23:057:003 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of
           the adulterer and the whore.

23:057:004 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a
           wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of
           transgression, a seed of falsehood.

23:057:005 Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree,
           slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the
           rocks?

23:057:006 Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they,
           they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink
           offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive
           comfort in these?

23:057:007 Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even
           thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.

23:057:008 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy
           remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than
           me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee
           a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest
           it.

23:057:009 And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase
           thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst
           debase thyself even unto hell.

23:057:010 Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou
           not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand;
           therefore thou wast not grieved.

23:057:011 And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast
           lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart?
           have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?

23:057:012 I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they
           shall not profit thee.

23:057:013 When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind
           shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that
           putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall
           inherit my holy mountain;

23:057:014 And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take
           up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

23:057:015 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth
           eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy
           place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,
           to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of
           the contrite ones.

23:057:016 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always
           wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls
           which I have made.

23:057:017 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote
           him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the
           way of his heart.

23:057:018 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also,
           and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

23:057:019 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is
           far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will
           heal him.

23:057:020 But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
           whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

23:057:021 There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

23:058:001 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and
           shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob
           their sins.

23:058:002 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a
           nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance
           of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they
           take delight in approaching to God.

23:058:003 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?
           wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no
           knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure,
           and exact all your labours.

23:058:004 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the
           fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to
           make your voice to be heard on high.

23:058:005 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to
           afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and
           to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a
           fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?

23:058:006 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of
           wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the
           oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?

23:058:007 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring
           the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the
           naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself
           from thine own flesh?

23:058:008 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine
           health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness
           shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy
           rereward.

23:058:009 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt
           cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the
           midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and
           speaking vanity;

23:058:010 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
           afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and
           thy darkness be as the noon day:

23:058:011 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy
           soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be
           like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose
           waters fail not.

23:058:012 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste
           places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many
           generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the
           breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.

23:058:013 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
           pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the
           holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing
           thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking
           thine own words:

23:058:014 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause
           thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee
           with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the
           LORD hath spoken it.

23:059:001 Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
           neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:

23:059:002 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
           and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not
           hear.

23:059:003 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
           iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath
           muttered perverseness.

23:059:004 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they
           trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and
           bring forth iniquity.

23:059:005 They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he
           that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed
           breaketh out into a viper.

23:059:006 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
           themselves with their works: their works are works of
           iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

23:059:007 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent
           blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and
           destruction are in their paths.

23:059:008 The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in
           their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever
           goeth therein shall not know peace.

23:059:009 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice
           overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for
           brightness, but we walk in darkness.

23:059:010 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we
           had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in
           desolate places as dead men.

23:059:011 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for
           judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off
           from us.

23:059:012 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our
           sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us;
           and as for our iniquities, we know them;

23:059:013 In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing
           away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving
           and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

23:059:014 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth
           afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot
           enter.

23:059:015 Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh
           himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him
           that there was no judgment.

23:059:016 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
           no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him;
           and his righteousness, it sustained him.

23:059:017 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of
           salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of
           vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.

23:059:018 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to
           his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he
           will repay recompence.

23:059:019 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his
           glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in
           like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard
           against him.

23:059:020 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn
           from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.

23:059:021 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My
           spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
           mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth
           of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith
           the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.

23:060:001 Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD
           is risen upon thee.

23:060:002 For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
           darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and
           his glory shall be seen upon thee.

23:060:003 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
           brightness of thy rising.

23:060:004 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather
           themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come
           from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.

23:060:005 Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall
           fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall
           be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come
           unto thee.

23:060:006 The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of
           Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall
           bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises
           of the LORD.

23:060:007 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee,
           the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come
           up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house
           of my glory.

23:060:008 Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
           windows?

23:060:009 Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish
           first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold
           with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy
           One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.

23:060:010 And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their
           kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee,
           but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.

23:060:011 Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not
           be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces
           of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.

23:060:012 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall
           perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.

23:060:013 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the
           pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my
           sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.

23:060:014 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending
           unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow
           themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call
           thee; The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of
           Israel.

23:060:015 Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went
           through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of
           many generations.

23:060:016 Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck
           the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am
           thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

23:060:017 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,
           and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy
           officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.

23:060:018 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor
           destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls
           Salvation, and thy gates Praise.

23:060:019 The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for
           brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD
           shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy
           glory.

23:060:020 Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw
           itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the
           days of thy mourning shall be ended.

23:060:021 Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the
           land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my
           hands, that I may be glorified.

23:060:022 A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong
           nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.

23:061:001 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
           anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent
           me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the
           captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are
           bound;

23:061:002 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of
           vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;

23:061:003 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them
           beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
           praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
           trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he
           might be glorified.

23:061:004 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
           former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities,
           the desolations of many generations.

23:061:005 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons
           of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

23:061:006 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call
           you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the
           Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.

23:061:007 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they
           shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they
           shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.

23:061:008 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt
           offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will
           make an everlasting covenant with them.

23:061:009 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
           offspring among the people: all that see them shall
           acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath
           blessed.

23:061:010 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in
           my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation,
           he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a
           bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride
           adorneth herself with her jewels.

23:061:011 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden
           causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the
           Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth
           before all the nations.

23:062:001 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's
           sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth
           as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that
           burneth.

23:062:002 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings
           thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the
           mouth of the LORD shall name.

23:062:003 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD,
           and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

23:062:004 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land
           any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called
           Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in
           thee, and thy land shall be married.

23:062:005 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry
           thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall
           thy God rejoice over thee.

23:062:006 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall
           never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of
           the LORD, keep not silence,

23:062:007 And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make
           Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

23:062:008 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his
           strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for
           thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink
           thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:

23:062:009 But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the
           LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in
           the courts of my holiness.

23:062:010 Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the
           people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;
           lift up a standard for the people.

23:062:011 Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world,
           Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh;
           behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.

23:062:012 And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the
           LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not
           forsaken.

23:063:001 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
           Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in
           the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness,
           mighty to save.

23:063:002 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like
           him that treadeth in the winefat?

23:063:003 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there
           was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and
           trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled
           upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.

23:063:004 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my
           redeemed is come.

23:063:005 And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that
           there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought
           salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.

23:063:006 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them
           drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the
           earth.

23:063:007 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the
           praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath
           bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of
           Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his
           mercies, and according to the multitude of his
           lovingkindnesses.

23:063:008 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not
           lie: so he was their Saviour.

23:063:009 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
           presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed
           them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.

23:063:010 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was
           turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.

23:063:011 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,
           saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with
           the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy
           Spirit within him?

23:063:012 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious
           arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an
           everlasting name?

23:063:013 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness,
           that they should not stumble?

23:063:014 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD
           caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make
           thyself a glorious name.

23:063:015 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
           holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength,
           the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are
           they restrained?

23:063:016 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of
           us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our
           father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.

23:063:017 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and
           hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants'
           sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.

23:063:018 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little
           while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

23:063:019 We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not
           called by thy name.

23:064:001 Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest
           come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,

23:064:002 As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters
           to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the
           nations may tremble at thy presence!

23:064:003 When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou
           camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.

23:064:004 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
           perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside
           thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.

23:064:005 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness,
           those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth;
           for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be
           saved.

23:064:006 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
           righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a
           leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

23:064:007 And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up
           himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from
           us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.

23:064:008 But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and
           thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.

23:064:009 Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for
           ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.

23:064:010 Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness,
           Jerusalem a desolation.

23:064:011 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised
           thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are
           laid waste.

23:064:012 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou
           hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?

23:065:001 I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them
           that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a
           nation that was not called by my name.

23:065:002 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious
           people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their
           own thoughts;

23:065:003 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face;
           that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars
           of brick;

23:065:004 Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments,
           which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in
           their vessels;

23:065:005 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am
           holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that
           burneth all the day.

23:065:006 Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but
           will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,

23:065:007 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,
           saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains,
           and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure
           their former work into their bosom.

23:065:008 Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
           and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so
           will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them
           all.

23:065:009 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah
           an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it,
           and my servants shall dwell there.

23:065:010 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor
           a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have
           sought me.

23:065:011 But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy
           mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that
           furnish the drink offering unto that number.

23:065:012 Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow
           down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not
           answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before
           mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.

23:065:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall
           eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink,
           but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice,
           but ye shall be ashamed:

23:065:014 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall
           cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of
           spirit.

23:065:015 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for
           the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another
           name:

23:065:016 That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself
           in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall
           swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are
           forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.

23:065:017 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
           former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

23:065:018 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create:
           for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a
           joy.

23:065:019 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
           voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice
           of crying.

23:065:020 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old
           man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an
           hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old
           shall be accursed.

23:065:021 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
           plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

23:065:022 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not
           plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days
           of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of
           their hands.

23:065:023 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble;
           for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their
           offspring with them.

23:065:024 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will
           answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

23:065:025 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
           eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's
           meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,
           saith the LORD.

23:066:001 Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is
           my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and
           where is the place of my rest?

23:066:002 For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things
           have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even
           to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at
           my word.

23:066:003 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that
           sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that
           offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that
           burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have
           chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their
           abominations.

23:066:004 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears
           upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I
           spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes,
           and chose that in which I delighted not.

23:066:005 Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your
           brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake,
           said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your
           joy, and they shall be ashamed.

23:066:006 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a
           voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.

23:066:007 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,
           she was delivered of a man child.

23:066:008 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall
           the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation
           be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought
           forth her children.

23:066:009 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?
           saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the
           womb? saith thy God.

23:066:010 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that
           love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:

23:066:011 That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her
           consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the
           abundance of her glory.

23:066:012 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her
           like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing
           stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides,
           and be dandled upon her knees.

23:066:013 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and
           ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

23:066:014 And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones
           shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be
           known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his
           enemies.

23:066:015 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his
           chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and
           his rebuke with flames of fire.

23:066:016 For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all
           flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.

23:066:017 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the
           gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh,
           and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed
           together, saith the LORD.

23:066:018 For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that
           I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come,
           and see my glory.

23:066:019 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that
           escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud,
           that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off,
           that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and
           they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.

23:066:020 And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto
           the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and
           in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy
           mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel
           bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the
           LORD.

23:066:021 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites,
           saith the LORD.

23:066:022 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
           shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and
           your name remain.

23:066:023 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,
           and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to
           worship before me, saith the LORD.

23:066:024 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men
           that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not
           die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be
           an abhorring unto all flesh.

Book 24        Jeremiah

24:001:001 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that
           were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:

24:001:002 To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the
           son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his
           reign.

24:001:003 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
           of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the
           son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of
           Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.

24:001:004 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

24:001:005 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou
           camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained
           thee a prophet unto the nations.

24:001:006 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a
           child.

24:001:007 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou
           shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I
           command thee thou shalt speak.

24:001:008 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver
           thee, saith the LORD.

24:001:009 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And
           the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy
           mouth.

24:001:010 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
           kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and
           to throw down, to build, and to plant.

24:001:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah,
           what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.

24:001:012 Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will
           hasten my word to perform it.

24:001:013 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
           What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the
           face thereof is toward the north.

24:001:014 Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall
           break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.

24:001:015 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
           north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set
           every one his throne at the entering of the gates of
           Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and
           against all the cities of Judah.

24:001:016 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
           wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
           other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.

24:001:017 Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto
           them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces,
           lest I confound thee before them.

24:001:018 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an
           iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against
           the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the
           priests thereof, and against the people of the land.

24:001:019 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail
           against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver
           thee.

24:002:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

24:002:002 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the
           LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of
           thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness,
           in a land that was not sown.

24:002:003 Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his
           increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come
           upon them, saith the LORD.

24:002:004 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the
           families of the house of Israel:

24:002:005 Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in
           me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after
           vanity, and are become vain?

24:002:006 Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of
           the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through
           a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and
           of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed
           through, and where no man dwelt?

24:002:007 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit
           thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye
           defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.

24:002:008 The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle
           the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me,
           and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things
           that do not profit.

24:002:009 Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with
           your children's children will I plead.

24:002:010 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto
           Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a
           thing.

24:002:011 Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but
           my people have changed their glory for that which doth not
           profit.

24:002:012 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid,
           be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.

24:002:013 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me
           the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns,
           broken cisterns, that can hold no water.

24:002:014 Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he
           spoiled?

24:002:015 The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his
           land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.

24:002:016 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown
           of thy head.

24:002:017 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast
           forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?

24:002:018 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the
           waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of
           Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?

24:002:019 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings
           shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil
           thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God,
           and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

24:002:020 For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands;
           and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high
           hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the
           harlot.

24:002:021 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how
           then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange
           vine unto me?

24:002:022 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap,
           yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.

24:002:023 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after
           Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done:
           thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;

24:002:024 A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind
           at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all
           they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month
           they shall find her.

24:002:025 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from
           thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have
           loved strangers, and after them will I go.

24:002:026 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of
           Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their
           priests, and their prophets.

24:002:027 Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou
           hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto
           me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they
           will say, Arise, and save us.

24:002:028 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them
           arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for
           according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.

24:002:029 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed
           against me, saith the LORD.

24:002:030 In vain have I smitten your children; they received no
           correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a
           destroying lion.

24:002:031 O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a
           wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my
           people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?

24:002:032 Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my
           people have forgotten me days without number.

24:002:033 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou
           also taught the wicked ones thy ways.

24:002:034 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
           innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all
           these.

24:002:035 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall
           turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou
           sayest, I have not sinned.

24:002:036 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also
           shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.

24:002:037 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine
           head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou
           shalt not prosper in them.

24:003:001 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and
           become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall
           not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the
           harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the
           LORD.

24:003:002 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou
           hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them,
           as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the
           land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.

24:003:003 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath
           been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou
           refusedst to be ashamed.

24:003:004 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art
           the guide of my youth?

24:003:005 Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the
           end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou
           couldest.

24:003:006 The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king,
           Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is
           gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree,
           and there hath played the harlot.

24:003:007 And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto
           me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw
           it.

24:003:008 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
           committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of
           divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went
           and played the harlot also.

24:003:009 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom,
           that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones
           and with stocks.

24:003:010 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not
           turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the
           LORD.

24:003:011 And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath
           justified herself more than treacherous Judah.

24:003:012 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,
           thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause
           mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the
           LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.

24:003:013 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
           against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the
           strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my
           voice, saith the LORD.

24:003:014 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married
           unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a
           family, and I will bring you to Zion:

24:003:015 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which
           shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

24:003:016 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased
           in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no
           more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it
           come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall
           they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.

24:003:017 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;
           and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of
           the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after
           the imagination of their evil heart.

24:003:018 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of
           Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the
           north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto
           your fathers.

24:003:019 But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give
           thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of
           nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt
           not turn away from me.

24:003:020 Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so
           have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith
           the LORD.

24:003:021 A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and
           supplications of the children of Israel: for they have
           perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their
           God.

24:003:022 Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your
           backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD
           our God.

24:003:023 Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from
           the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the
           salvation of Israel.

24:003:024 For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our
           youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their
           daughters.

24:003:025 We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for
           we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers,
           from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the
           voice of the LORD our God.

24:004:001 If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me:
           and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight,
           then shalt thou not remove.

24:004:002 And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment,
           and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves
           in him, and in him shall they glory.

24:004:003 For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem,
           Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.

24:004:004 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins
           of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem:
           lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can
           quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

24:004:005 Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow
           ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say,
           Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.

24:004:006 Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will
           bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.

24:004:007 The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the
           Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to
           make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste,
           without an inhabitant.

24:004:008 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the
           fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.

24:004:009 And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that
           the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the
           princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets
           shall wonder.

24:004:010 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived
           this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace;
           whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.

24:004:011 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem,
           A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the
           daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,

24:004:012 Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now
           also will I give sentence against them.

24:004:013 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be
           as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto
           us! for we are spoiled.

24:004:014 O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou
           mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within
           thee?

24:004:015 For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from
           mount Ephraim.

24:004:016 Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against
           Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out
           their voice against the cities of Judah.

24:004:017 As keepers of a field, are they against her round about;
           because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.

24:004:018 Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee;
           this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it
           reacheth unto thine heart.

24:004:019 My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart
           maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou
           hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of
           war.

24:004:020 Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is
           spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a
           moment.

24:004:021 How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the
           trumpet?

24:004:022 For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are
           sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are
           wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

24:004:023 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void;
           and the heavens, and they had no light.

24:004:024 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the
           hills moved lightly.

24:004:025 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the
           heavens were fled.

24:004:026 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and
           all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the
           LORD, and by his fierce anger.

24:004:027 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate;
           yet will I not make a full end.

24:004:028 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be
           black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will
           not repent, neither will I turn back from it.

24:004:029 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
           bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the
           rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell
           therein.

24:004:030 And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou
           clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with
           ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting,
           in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise
           thee, they will seek thy life.

24:004:031 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the
           anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the
           voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that
           spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is
           wearied because of murderers.

24:005:001 Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see
           now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can
           find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that
           seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.

24:005:002 And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear
           falsely.

24:005:003 O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken
           them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but
           they have refused to receive correction: they have made their
           faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.

24:005:004 Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for
           they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their
           God.

24:005:005 I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them;
           for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of
           their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and
           burst the bonds.

24:005:006 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf
           of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over
           their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in
           pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their
           backslidings are increased.

24:005:007 How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken
           me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to
           the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled
           themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.

24:005:008 They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed
           after his neighbour's wife.

24:005:009 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall
           not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

24:005:010 Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end:
           take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.

24:005:011 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very
           treacherously against me, saith the LORD.

24:005:012 They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither
           shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor
           famine:

24:005:013 And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in
           them: thus shall it be done unto them.

24:005:014 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak
           this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and
           this people wood, and it shall devour them.

24:005:015 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of
           Israel, saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an
           ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not,
           neither understandest what they say.

24:005:016 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.

24:005:017 And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy
           sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy
           flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy
           fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein
           thou trustedst, with the sword.

24:005:018 Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a
           full end with you.

24:005:019 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth
           the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou
           answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange
           gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that
           is not your's.

24:005:020 Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah,
           saying,

24:005:021 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding;
           which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:

24:005:022 Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my
           presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea
           by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the
           waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail;
           though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?

24:005:023 But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they
           are revolted and gone.

24:005:024 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our
           God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his
           season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the
           harvest.

24:005:025 Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins
           have withholden good things from you.

24:005:026 For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he
           that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.

24:005:027 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of
           deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.

24:005:028 They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds
           of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the
           fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do
           they not judge.

24:005:029 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not
           my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

24:005:030 A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;

24:005:031 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by
           their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will
           ye do in the end thereof?

24:006:001 O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of
           the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set
           up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of
           the north, and great destruction.

24:006:002 I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate
           woman.

24:006:003 The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they
           shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall
           feed every one in his place.

24:006:004 Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon.
           Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the
           evening are stretched out.

24:006:005 Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.

24:006:006 For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and
           cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be
           visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.

24:006:007 As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her
           wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me
           continually is grief and wounds.

24:006:008 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from
           thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.

24:006:009 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the
           remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a
           grapegatherer into the baskets.

24:006:010 To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?
           behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken:
           behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they
           have no delight in it.

24:006:011 Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with
           holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and
           upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband
           with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full
           of days.

24:006:012 And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their
           fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon
           the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.

24:006:013 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them
           every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even
           unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

24:006:014 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people
           slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

24:006:015 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
           they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
           therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time
           that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.

24:006:016 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask
           for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein,
           and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will
           not walk therein.

24:006:017 Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of
           the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

24:006:018 Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is
           among them.

24:006:019 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people,
           even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not
           hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.

24:006:020 To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the
           sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not
           acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.

24:006:021 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay
           stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the
           sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his
           friend shall perish.

24:006:022 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north
           country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of
           the earth.

24:006:023 They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have
           no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon
           horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter
           of Zion.

24:006:024 We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish
           hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

24:006:025 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the
           sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.

24:006:026 O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow
           thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most
           bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon
           us.

24:006:027 I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people,
           that thou mayest know and try their way.

24:006:028 They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they
           are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.

24:006:029 The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the
           founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

24:006:030 Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath
           rejected them.

24:007:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

24:007:002 Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this
           word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah,
           that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.

24:007:003 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your
           ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this
           place.

24:007:004 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD,
           The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.

24:007:005 For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye
           throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;

24:007:006 If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow,
           and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after
           other gods to your hurt:

24:007:007 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that
           I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.

24:007:008 Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.

24:007:009 Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,
           and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye
           know not;

24:007:010 And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by
           my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these
           abominations?

24:007:011 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of
           robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the
           LORD.

24:007:012 But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set
           my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the
           wickedness of my people Israel.

24:007:013 And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD,
           and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye
           heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;

24:007:014 Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my
           name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you
           and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.

24:007:015 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all
           your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.

24:007:016 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry
           nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I
           will not hear thee.

24:007:017 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the
           streets of Jerusalem?

24:007:018 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and
           the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of
           heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that
           they may provoke me to anger.

24:007:019 Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not
           provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?

24:007:020 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my
           fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon
           beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of
           the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.

24:007:021 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your
           burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.

24:007:022 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the
           day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning
           burnt offerings or sacrifices:

24:007:023 But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I
           will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in
           all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well
           unto you.

24:007:024 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in
           the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and
           went backward, and not forward.

24:007:025 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of
           Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants
           the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:

24:007:026 Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but
           hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.

24:007:027 Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they
           will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but
           they will not answer thee.

24:007:028 But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth
           not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction:
           truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.

24:007:029 Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up
           a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and
           forsaken the generation of his wrath.

24:007:030 For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith
           the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which
           is called by my name, to pollute it.

24:007:031 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the
           valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their
           daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither
           came it into my heart.

24:007:032 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it
           shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of
           Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in
           Tophet, till there be no place.

24:007:033 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of
           the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall
           fray them away.

24:007:034 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from
           the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of
           gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the
           bride: for the land shall be desolate.

24:008:001 At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones
           of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the
           bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the
           bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:

24:008:002 And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and
           all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they
           have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they
           have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be
           gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face
           of the earth.

24:008:003 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue
           of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all
           the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of
           hosts.

24:008:004 Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall
           they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?

24:008:005 Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a
           perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to
           return.

24:008:006 I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man
           repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?
           every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the
           battle.

24:008:007 Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and
           the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of
           their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.

24:008:008 How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with
           us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes
           is in vain.

24:008:009 The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo,
           they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in
           them?

24:008:010 Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their
           fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the
           least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from
           the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

24:008:011 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people
           slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

24:008:012 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
           they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
           therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of
           their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.

24:008:013 I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no
           grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf
           shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass
           away from them.

24:008:014 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter
           into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the
           LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of
           gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.

24:008:015 We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of
           health, and behold trouble!

24:008:016 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land
           trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for
           they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in
           it; the city, and those that dwell therein.

24:008:017 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you,
           which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the
           LORD.

24:008:018 When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint
           in me.

24:008:019 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people
           because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD
           in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to
           anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?

24:008:020 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not
           saved.

24:008:021 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am
           black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.

24:008:022 Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why
           then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

24:009:001 Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of
           tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the
           daughter of my people!

24:009:002 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring
           men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they
           be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.

24:009:003 And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they
           are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed
           from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.

24:009:004 Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in
           any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and
           every neighbour will walk with slanders.

24:009:005 And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not
           speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies,
           and weary themselves to commit iniquity.

24:009:006 Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit
           they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.

24:009:007 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt
           them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my
           people?

24:009:008 Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one
           speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in
           heart he layeth his wait.

24:009:009 Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall
           not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

24:009:010 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and
           for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because
           they are burned up, so that none can pass through them;
           neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of
           the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.

24:009:011 And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I
           will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.

24:009:012 Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he
           to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare
           it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a
           wilderness, that none passeth through?

24:009:013 And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I
           set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked
           therein;

24:009:014 But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and
           after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:

24:009:015 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
           Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and
           give them water of gall to drink.

24:009:016 I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they
           nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after
           them, till I have consumed them.

24:009:017 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the
           mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning
           women, that they may come:

24:009:018 And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that
           our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out
           with waters.

24:009:019 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we
           spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken
           the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.

24:009:020 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear
           receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters
           wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.

24:009:021 For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our
           palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young
           men from the streets.

24:009:022 Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall
           fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the
           harvestman, and none shall gather them.

24:009:023 Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
           neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the
           rich man glory in his riches:

24:009:024 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth
           and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise
           lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for
           in these things I delight, saith the LORD.

24:009:025 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all
           them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;

24:009:026 Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and
           Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in
           the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and
           all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.

24:010:001 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of
           Israel:

24:010:002 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be
           not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are
           dismayed at them.

24:010:003 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree
           out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with
           the axe.

24:010:004 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with
           nails and with hammers, that it move not.

24:010:005 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must
           needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them;
           for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do
           good.

24:010:006 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art
           great, and thy name is great in might.

24:010:007 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth
           it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the
           nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto
           thee.

24:010:008 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a
           doctrine of vanities.

24:010:009 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold
           from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the
           founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the
           work of cunning men.

24:010:010 But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an
           everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and
           the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.

24:010:011 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the
           heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth,
           and from under these heavens.

24:010:012 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
           world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his
           discretion.

24:010:013 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
           the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the
           ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and
           bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

24:010:014 Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is
           confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is
           falsehood, and there is no breath in them.

24:010:015 They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their
           visitation they shall perish.

24:010:016 The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of
           all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD
           of hosts is his name.

24:010:017 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the
           fortress.

24:010:018 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the
           inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them,
           that they may find it so.

24:010:019 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly
           this is a grief, and I must bear it.

24:010:020 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my
           children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none
           to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.

24:010:021 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the
           LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks
           shall be scattered.

24:010:022 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion
           out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah
           desolate, and a den of dragons.

24:010:023 O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is
           not in man that walketh to direct his steps.

24:010:024 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger,
           lest thou bring me to nothing.

24:010:025 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and
           upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have
           eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have
           made his habitation desolate.

24:011:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,

24:011:002 Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of
           Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;

24:011:003 And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel;
           Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,

24:011:004 Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them
           forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying,
           Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command
           you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:

24:011:005 That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your
           fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as
           it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.

24:011:006 Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the
           cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear
           ye the words of this covenant, and do them.

24:011:007 For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I
           brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day,
           rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.

24:011:008 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every
           one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will
           bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I
           commanded them to do: but they did them not.

24:011:009 And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men
           of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

24:011:010 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,
           which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods
           to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have
           broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.

24:011:011 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon
           them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they
           shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.

24:011:012 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem
           go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but
           they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.

24:011:013 For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O
           Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem
           have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to
           burn incense unto Baal.

24:011:014 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry
           or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that
           they cry unto me for their trouble.

24:011:015 What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath
           wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from
           thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.

24:011:016 The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of
           goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled
           fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.

24:011:017 For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil
           against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the
           house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to
           provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.

24:011:018 And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it:
           then thou shewedst me their doings.

24:011:019 But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the
           slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices
           against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit
           thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living,
           that his name may be no more remembered.

24:011:020 But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest
           the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for
           unto thee have I revealed my cause.

24:011:021 Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that
           seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD,
           that thou die not by our hand:

24:011:022 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish
           them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and
           their daughters shall die by famine:

24:011:023 And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil
           upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

24:012:001 Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me
           talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the
           wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very
           treacherously?

24:012:002 Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow,
           yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and
           far from their reins.

24:012:003 But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried
           mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the
           slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.

24:012:004 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field
           wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the
           beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He
           shall not see our last end.

24:012:005 If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee,
           then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of
           peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how
           wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?

24:012:006 For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they
           have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a
           multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair
           words unto thee.

24:012:007 I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have
           given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her
           enemies.

24:012:008 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth
           out against me: therefore have I hated it.

24:012:009 Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round
           about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the
           field, come to devour.

24:012:010 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my
           portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a
           desolate wilderness.

24:012:011 They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth
           unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man
           layeth it to heart.

24:012:012 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the
           wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the
           one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no
           flesh shall have peace.

24:012:013 They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put
           themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be
           ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the
           LORD.

24:012:014 Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that
           touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to
           inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and
           pluck out the house of Judah from among them.

24:012:015 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out
           I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring
           them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his
           land.

24:012:016 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the
           ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as
           they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be
           built in the midst of my people.

24:012:017 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy
           that nation, saith the LORD.

24:013:001 Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle,
           and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.

24:013:002 So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put
           it on my loins.

24:013:003 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,

24:013:004 Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins,
           and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the
           rock.

24:013:005 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.

24:013:006 And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto
           me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence,
           which I commanded thee to hide there.

24:013:007 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from
           the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was
           marred, it was profitable for nothing.

24:013:008 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

24:013:009 Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of
           Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.

24:013:010 This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in
           the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to
           serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle,
           which is good for nothing.

24:013:011 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I
           caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the
           whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto
           me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a
           glory: but they would not hear.

24:013:012 Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the
           LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine:
           and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that
           every bottle shall be filled with wine?

24:013:013 Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I
           will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings
           that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the
           prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with
           drunkenness.

24:013:014 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and
           the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare,
           nor have mercy, but destroy them.

24:013:015 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.

24:013:016 Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and
           before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while
           ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and
           make it gross darkness.

24:013:017 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret
           places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run
           down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away
           captive.

24:013:018 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit
           down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown
           of your glory.

24:013:019 The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open
           them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall
           be wholly carried away captive.

24:013:020 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north:
           where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?

24:013:021 What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast
           taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not
           sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?

24:013:022 And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things
           upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts
           discovered, and thy heels made bare.

24:013:023 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
           then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.

24:013:024 Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away
           by the wind of the wilderness.

24:013:025 This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith
           the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in
           falsehood.

24:013:026 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy
           shame may appear.

24:013:027 I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness
           of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the
           fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made
           clean? when shall it once be?

24:014:001 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the
           dearth.

24:014:002 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black
           unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.

24:014:003 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters:
           they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with
           their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and
           covered their heads.

24:014:004 Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the
           earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.

24:014:005 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it,
           because there was no grass.

24:014:006 And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed
           up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there
           was no grass.

24:014:007 O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it
           for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have
           sinned against thee.

24:014:008 O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble,
           why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a
           wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?

24:014:009 Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that
           cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we
           are called by thy name; leave us not.

24:014:010 Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to
           wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD
           doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and
           visit their sins.

24:014:011 Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their
           good.

24:014:012 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer
           burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I
           will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the
           pestilence.

24:014:013 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them,
           Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but
           I will give you assured peace in this place.

24:014:014 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my
           name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither
           spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and
           divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their
           heart.

24:014:015 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that
           prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword
           and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine
           shall those prophets be consumed.

24:014:016 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
           streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and
           they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor
           their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their
           wickedness upon them.

24:014:017 Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes
           run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for
           the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great
           breach, with a very grievous blow.

24:014:018 If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the
           sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are
           sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go
           about into a land that they know not.

24:014:019 Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion?
           why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we
           looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of
           healing, and behold trouble!

24:014:020 We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of
           our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.

24:014:021 Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the
           throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.

24:014:022 Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can
           cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he,
           O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou
           hast made all these things.

24:015:001 Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood
           before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast
           them out of my sight, and let them go forth.

24:015:002 And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither
           shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the
           LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the
           sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the
           famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.

24:015:003 And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the
           sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the
           heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.

24:015:004 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
           earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah,
           for that which he did in Jerusalem.

24:015:005 For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall
           bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?

24:015:006 Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward:
           therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy
           thee; I am weary with repenting.

24:015:007 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I
           will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since
           they return not from their ways.

24:015:008 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I
           have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a
           spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it
           suddenly, and terrors upon the city.

24:015:009 She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the
           ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath
           been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I
           deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.

24:015:010 Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife
           and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither
           lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one
           of them doth curse me.

24:015:011 The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant;
           verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time
           of evil and in the time of affliction.

24:015:012 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?

24:015:013 Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil
           without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy
           borders.

24:015:014 And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land
           which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger,
           which shall burn upon you.

24:015:015 O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge
           me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering:
           know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.

24:015:016 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was
           unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called
           by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.

24:015:017 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat
           alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with
           indignation.

24:015:018 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which
           refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a
           liar, and as waters that fail?

24:015:019 Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I
           bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou
           take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my
           mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto
           them.

24:015:020 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall:
           and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail
           against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver
           thee, saith the LORD.

24:015:021 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I
           will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.

24:016:001 The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,

24:016:002 Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons
           or daughters in this place.

24:016:003 For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
           daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their
           mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that
           begat them in this land;

24:016:004 They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented;
           neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon
           the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the
           sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the
           fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

24:016:005 For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning,
           neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my
           peace from this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindness
           and mercies.

24:016:006 Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they
           shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor
           cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:

24:016:007 Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to
           comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup
           of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.

24:016:008 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with
           them to eat and to drink.

24:016:009 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
           will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in
           your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the
           voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.

24:016:010 And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people
           all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath
           the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is
           our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed
           against the LORD our God?

24:016:011 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have
           forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods,
           and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have
           forsaken me, and have not kept my law;

24:016:012 And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk
           every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they
           may not hearken unto me:

24:016:013 Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye
           know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye
           serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you
           favour.

24:016:014 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it
           shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the
           children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

24:016:015 But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel
           from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he
           had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land
           that I gave unto their fathers.

24:016:016 Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they
           shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and
           they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill,
           and out of the holes of the rocks.

24:016:017 For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from
           my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.

24:016:018 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin
           double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled
           mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and
           abominable things.

24:016:019 O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day
           of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends
           of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited
           lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.

24:016:020 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?

24:016:021 Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will
           cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know
           that my name is The LORD.

24:017:001 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the
           point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their
           heart, and upon the horns of your altars;

24:017:002 Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves
           by the green trees upon the high hills.

24:017:003 O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all
           thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin,
           throughout all thy borders.

24:017:004 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage
           that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies
           in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire
           in mine anger, which shall burn for ever.

24:017:005 Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man,
           and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the
           LORD.

24:017:006 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not
           see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in
           the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.

24:017:007 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope
           the LORD is.

24:017:008 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that
           spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when
           heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be
           careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from
           yielding fruit.

24:017:009 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
           wicked: who can know it?

24:017:010 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
           every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of
           his doings.

24:017:011 As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he
           that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the
           midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.

24:017:012 A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our
           sanctuary.

24:017:013 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be
           ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the
           earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of
           living waters.

24:017:014 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall
           be saved: for thou art my praise.

24:017:015 Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let
           it come now.

24:017:016 As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow
           thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest:
           that which came out of my lips was right before thee.

24:017:017 Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.

24:017:018 Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be
           confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed:
           bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double
           destruction.

24:017:019 Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the
           children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in,
           and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of
           Jerusalem;

24:017:020 And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of
           Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
           that enter in by these gates:

24:017:021 Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no
           burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of
           Jerusalem;

24:017:022 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath
           day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as
           I commanded your fathers.

24:017:023 But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made
           their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive
           instruction.

24:017:024 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me,
           saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of
           this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to
           do no work therein;

24:017:025 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and
           princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots
           and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and
           the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for
           ever.

24:017:026 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the
           places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and
           from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south,
           bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings,
           and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house
           of the LORD.

24:017:027 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day,
           and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of
           Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the
           gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem,
           and it shall not be quenched.

24:018:001 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

24:018:002 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will
           cause thee to hear my words.

24:018:003 Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he
           wrought a work on the wheels.

24:018:004 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of
           the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good
           to the potter to make it.

24:018:005 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

24:018:006 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith
           the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are
           ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.

24:018:007 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
           concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to
           destroy it;

24:018:008 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from
           their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do
           unto them.

24:018:009 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
           concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;

24:018:010 If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I
           will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit
           them.

24:018:011 Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the
           inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold,
           I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you:
           return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways
           and your doings good.

24:018:012 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our
           own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his
           evil heart.

24:018:013 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen,
           who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a
           very horrible thing.

24:018:014 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the
           rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come
           from another place be forsaken?

24:018:015 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense
           to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways
           from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast
           up;

24:018:016 To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every
           one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his
           head.

24:018:017 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I
           will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their
           calamity.

24:018:018 Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against
           Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor
           counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come,
           and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed
           to any of his words.

24:018:019 Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that
           contend with me.

24:018:020 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit
           for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good
           for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.

24:018:021 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour
           out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives
           be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their
           men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword
           in battle.

24:018:022 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a
           troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take
           me, and hid snares for my feet.

24:018:023 Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay
           me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin
           from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal
           thus with them in the time of thine anger.

24:019:001 Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and
           take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the
           priests;

24:019:002 And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by
           the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that
           I shall tell thee,

24:019:003 And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and
           inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
           God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the
           which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.

24:019:004 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place,
           and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither
           they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and
           have filled this place with the blood of innocents;

24:019:005 They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their
           sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I
           commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:

24:019:006 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this
           place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the
           son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.

24:019:007 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in
           this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before
           their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives:
           and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the
           heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

24:019:008 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one
           that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of
           all the plagues thereof.

24:019:009 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the
           flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the
           flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith
