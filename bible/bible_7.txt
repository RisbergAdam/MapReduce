           my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to
           build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for
           the building:

13:028:003 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my
           name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed
           blood.

13:028:004 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house
           of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath
           chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the
           house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked
           me to make me king over all Israel:

13:028:005 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he
           hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
           kingdom of the LORD over Israel.

13:028:006 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house
           and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will
           be his father.

13:028:007 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be
           constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this
           day.

13:028:008 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of
           the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for
           all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess
           this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your
           children after you for ever.

13:028:009 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
           serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for
           the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the
           imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be
           found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
           for ever.

13:028:010 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house
           for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

13:028:011 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch,
           and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and
           of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours
           thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,

13:028:012 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the
           courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round
           about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the
           treasuries of the dedicated things:

13:028:013 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for
           all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for
           all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.

13:028:014 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all
           instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all
           instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every
           kind of service:

13:028:015 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
           lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the
           lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight,
           both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof,
           according to the use of every candlestick.

13:028:016 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for
           every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:

13:028:017 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the
           cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for
           every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of
           silver:

13:028:018 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold
           for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread
           out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD.

13:028:019 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing
           by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

13:028:020 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
           courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD
           God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee,
           nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for
           the service of the house of the LORD.

13:028:021 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even
           they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of
           God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of
           workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of
           service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at
           thy commandment.

13:029:001 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
           Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and
           tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man,
           but for the LORD God.

13:029:002 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
           the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for
           things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron
           for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones,
           and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers
           colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones
           in abundance.

13:029:003 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my
           God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which
           I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I
           have prepared for the holy house.

13:029:004 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
           seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls
           of the houses withal:

13:029:005 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of
           silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of
           artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service
           this day unto the LORD?

13:029:006 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of
           Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the
           rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,

13:029:007 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five
           thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten
           thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and
           one hundred thousand talents of iron.

13:029:008 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
           treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the
           Gershonite.

13:029:009 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
           because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD:
           and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

13:029:010 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
           and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our
           father, for ever and ever.

13:029:011 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
           and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the
           heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O
           LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.

13:029:012 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over
           all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand
           it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.

13:029:013 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
           name.

13:029:014 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
           offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of
           thee, and of thine own have we given thee.

13:029:015 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
           our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there
           is none abiding.

13:029:016 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
           thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is
           all thine own.

13:029:017 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
           pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine
           heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have
           I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer
           willingly unto thee.

13:029:018 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
           this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart
           of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:

13:029:019 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
           commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all
           these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have
           made provision.

13:029:020 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD
           your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of
           their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the
           LORD, and the king.

13:029:021 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered
           burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day,
           even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand
           lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
           for all Israel:

13:029:022 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great
           gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the
           second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief
           governor, and Zadok to be priest.

13:029:023 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of
           David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

13:029:024 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
           likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the
           king.

13:029:025 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
           Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not
           been on any king before him in Israel.

13:029:026 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

13:029:027 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years;
           seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
           reigned he in Jerusalem.

13:029:028 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and
           honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

13:029:029 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they
           are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of
           Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

13:029:030 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over
           him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the
           countries.

Book 14        2 Chronicles

14:001:001 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
           and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him
           exceedingly.

14:001:002 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of
           thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
           governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.

14:001:003 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the
           high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of
           the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD
           had made in the wilderness.

14:001:004 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to
           the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched
           a tent for it at Jerusalem.

14:001:005 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the
           son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the
           LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.

14:001:006 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the
           LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and
           offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.

14:001:007 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,
           Ask what I shall give thee.

14:001:008 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto
           David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.

14:001:009 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
           established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the
           dust of the earth in multitude.

14:001:010 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
           in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that
           is so great?

14:001:011 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and
           thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of
           thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast
           asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge
           my people, over whom I have made thee king:

14:001:012 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give
           thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings
           have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any
           after thee have the like.

14:001:013 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was
           at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and reigned over Israel.

14:001:014 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a
           thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
           horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the
           king at Jerusalem.

14:001:015 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
           stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are
           in the vale for abundance.

14:001:016 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
           the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

14:001:017 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot
           for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred
           and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of
           the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

14:002:001 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the
           LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

14:002:002 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
           burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and
           three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.

14:002:003 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou
           didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to
           build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.

14:002:004 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to
           dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and
           for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings
           morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
           and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an
           ordinance for ever to Israel.

14:002:005 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God
           above all gods.

14:002:006 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
           heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I
           should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before
           him?

14:002:007 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
           silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,
           and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men
           that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my
           father did provide.

14:002:008 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
           Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber
           in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy
           servants,

14:002:009 Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I
           am about to build shall be wonderful great.

14:002:010 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
           timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty
           thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of
           wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

14:002:011 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent
           to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath
           made thee king over them.

14:002:012 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that
           made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise
           son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build
           an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

14:002:013 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding,
           of Huram my father's,

14:002:014 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was
           a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in
           brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue,
           and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of
           graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to
           him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord
           David thy father.

14:002:015 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the
           wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his
           servants:

14:002:016 And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt
           need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa;
           and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.

14:002:017 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land
           of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had
           numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty
           thousand and three thousand and six hundred.

14:002:018 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers
           of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the
           mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set
           the people a work.

14:003:001 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem
           in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his
           father, in the place that David had prepared in the
           threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

14:003:002 And he began to build in the second day of the second month,
           in the fourth year of his reign.

14:003:003 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for
           the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after
           the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth
           twenty cubits.

14:003:004 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length
           of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty
           cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he
           overlaid it within with pure gold.

14:003:005 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he
           overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and
           chains.

14:003:006 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
           and the gold was gold of Parvaim.

14:003:007 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the
           walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved
           cherubims on the walls.

14:003:008 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was
           according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the
           breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine
           gold, amounting to six hundred talents.

14:003:009 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
           overlaid the upper chambers with gold.

14:003:010 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image
           work, and overlaid them with gold.

14:003:011 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one
           wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall
           of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits,
           reaching to the wing of the other cherub.

14:003:012 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to
           the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits
           also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.

14:003:013 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
           cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were
           inward.

14:003:014 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and
           fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

14:003:015 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
           cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of
           them was five cubits.

14:003:016 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the
           heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and
           put them on the chains.

14:003:017 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the
           right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of
           that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the
           left Boaz.

14:004:001 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
           thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits
           the height thereof.

14:004:002 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
           round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a
           line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

14:004:003 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
           round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.
           Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.

14:004:004 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
           three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
           south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
           above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

14:004:005 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
           like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies;
           and it received and held three thousand baths.

14:004:006 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and
           five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered
           for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was
           for the priests to wash in.

14:004:007 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form,
           and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five
           on the left.

14:004:008 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five
           on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an
           hundred basons of gold.

14:004:009 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great
           court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them
           with brass.

14:004:010 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
           against the south.

14:004:011 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
           Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon
           for the house of God;

14:004:012 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters
           which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths
           to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the
           top of the pillars;

14:004:013 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
           pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the
           chapiters which were upon the pillars.

14:004:014 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;

14:004:015 One sea, and twelve oxen under it.

14:004:016 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all
           their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon
           for the house of the LORD of bright brass.

14:004:017 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
           ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.

14:004:018 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for
           the weight of the brass could not be found out.

14:004:019 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of
           God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the
           shewbread was set;

14:004:020 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should
           burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;

14:004:021 And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of
           gold, and that perfect gold;

14:004:022 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
           censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner
           doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the
           house of the temple, were of gold.

14:005:001 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD
           was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David
           his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and
           all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house
           of God.

14:005:002 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
           of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
           Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of
           the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.

14:005:003 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the
           king in the feast which was in the seventh month.

14:005:004 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
           ark.

14:005:005 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
           tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.

14:005:006 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that
           were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and
           oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

14:005:007 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy
           place, even under the wings of the cherubims:

14:005:008 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of
           the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
           thereof above.

14:005:009 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
           staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were
           not seen without. And there it is unto this day.

14:005:010 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses
           put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the
           children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

14:005:011 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
           holy place: (for all the priests that were present were
           sanctified, and did not then wait by course:

14:005:012 Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph,
           of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,
           being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries
           and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them
           an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)

14:005:013 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as
           one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking
           the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the
           trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised
           the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for
           ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the
           house of the LORD;

14:005:014 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
           the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of
           God.

14:006:001 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in
           the thick darkness.

14:006:002 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place
           for thy dwelling for ever.

14:006:003 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole
           congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel
           stood.

14:006:004 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with
           his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my
           father David, saying,

14:006:005 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land
           of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to
           build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose
           I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:

14:006:006 But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and
           have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

14:006:007 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
           for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

14:006:008 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in
           thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in
           that it was in thine heart:

14:006:009 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son
           which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
           house for my name.

14:006:010 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath
           spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and
           am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have
           built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

14:006:011 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
           LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.

14:006:012 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
           all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:

14:006:013 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long,
           and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it
           in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled
           down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and
           spread forth his hands toward heaven.

14:006:014 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in
           the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
           shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with
           all their hearts:

14:006:015 Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that
           which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and
           hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

14:006:016 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant
           David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying,
           There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the
           throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their
           way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.

14:006:017 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified,
           which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.

14:006:018 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
           heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much
           less this house which I have built!

14:006:019 Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to
           his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
           the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:

14:006:020 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,
           upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put
           thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant
           prayeth toward this place.

14:006:021 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and
           of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place:
           hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when
           thou hearest, forgive.

14:006:022 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
           him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in
           this house;

14:006:023 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
           requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own
           head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according
           to his righteousness.

14:006:024 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
           because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and
           confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee
           in this house;

14:006:025 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
           people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou
           gavest to them and to their fathers.

14:006:026 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
           have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place,
           and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost
           afflict them;

14:006:027 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy
           servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them
           the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy
           land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an
           inheritance.

14:006:028 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if
           there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if
           their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land;
           whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:

14:006:029 Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of
           any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall
           know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth
           his hands in this house:

14:006:030 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive,
           and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose
           heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the
           children of men:)

14:006:031 That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they
           live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

14:006:032 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people
           Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's
           sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they
           come and pray in this house;

14:006:033 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
           and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for;
           that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee,
           as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which
           I have built is called by thy name.

14:006:034 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way
           that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this
           city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built
           for thy name;

14:006:035 Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their
           supplication, and maintain their cause.

14:006:036 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth
           not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over
           before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a
           land far off or near;

14:006:037 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are
           carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of
           their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss,
           and have dealt wickedly;

14:006:038 If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their
           soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried
           them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest
           unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast
           chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:

14:006:039 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
           their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their
           cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.

14:006:040 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let
           thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this
           place.

14:006:041 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,
           and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be
           clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in
           goodness.

14:006:042 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember
           the mercies of David thy servant.

14:007:001 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came
           down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the
           sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.

14:007:002 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
           because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.

14:007:003 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came
           down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed
           themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement,
           and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good;
           for his mercy endureth for ever.

14:007:004 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
           LORD.

14:007:005 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two
           thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so
           the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

14:007:006 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
           instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had
           made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever,
           when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded
           trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.

14:007:007 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was
           before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
           offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the
           brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive
           the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.

14:007:008 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and
           all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the
           entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

14:007:009 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they
           kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast
           seven days.

14:007:010 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he
           sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart
           for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to
           Solomon, and to Israel his people.

14:007:011 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's
           house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the
           house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously
           effected.

14:007:012 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him,
           I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself
           for an house of sacrifice.

14:007:013 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
           locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my
           people;

14:007:014 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
           themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
           wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
           their sin, and will heal their land.

14:007:015 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
           prayer that is made in this place.

14:007:016 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name
           may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be
           there perpetually.

14:007:017 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy
           father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded
           thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;

14:007:018 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I
           have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not
           fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.

14:007:019 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my
           commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and
           serve other gods, and worship them;

14:007:020 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I
           have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for
           my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a
           proverb and a byword among all nations.

14:007:021 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to
           every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath
           the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?

14:007:022 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of
           their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of
           Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
           served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon
           them.

14:008:001 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein
           Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,

14:008:002 That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon
           built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.

14:008:003 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.

14:008:004 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store
           cities, which he built in Hamath.

14:008:005 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
           fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

14:008:006 And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and
           all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and
           all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in
           Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.

14:008:007 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
           Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
           Jebusites, which were not of Israel,

14:008:008 But of their children, who were left after them in the land,
           whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon
           make to pay tribute until this day.

14:008:009 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for
           his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains,
           and captains of his chariots and horsemen.

14:008:010 And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two
           hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.

14:008:011 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city
           of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he
           said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
           Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the
           LORD hath come.

14:008:012 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the
           altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,

14:008:013 Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the
           commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
           and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the
           feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in
           the feast of tabernacles.

14:008:014 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father,
           the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites
           to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests,
           as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their
           courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God
           commanded.

14:008:015 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto
           the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning
           the treasures.

14:008:016 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
           foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was
           finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.

14:008:017 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side
           in the land of Edom.

14:008:018 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
           servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the
           servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and
           fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

14:009:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she
           came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a
           very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in
           abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to
           Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

14:009:002 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing
           hid from Solomon which he told her not.

14:009:003 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
           and the house that he had built,

14:009:004 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
           and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his
           cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he
           went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit
           in her.

14:009:005 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard
           in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

14:009:006 Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine
           eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness
           of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame
           that I heard.

14:009:007 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which
           stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

14:009:008 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set
           thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because
           thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore
           made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.

14:009:009 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
           and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither
           was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king
           Solomon.

14:009:010 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
           which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and
           precious stones.

14:009:011 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of
           the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries
           for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land
           of Judah.

14:009:012 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
           whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto
           the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she
           and her servants.

14:009:013 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
           six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

14:009:014 Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the
           kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and
           silver to Solomon.

14:009:015 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
           hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

14:009:016 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three
           hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put
           them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

14:009:017 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
           it with pure gold.

14:009:018 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of
           gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each
           side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the
           stays:

14:009:019 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
           upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any
           kingdom.

14:009:020 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and
           all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of
           pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted
           of in the days of Solomon.

14:009:021 For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of
           Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish
           bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

14:009:022 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches
           and wisdom.

14:009:023 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
           to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.

14:009:024 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
           vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and
           mules, a rate year by year.

14:009:025 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots,
           and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot
           cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

14:009:026 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
           land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

14:009:027 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar
           trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains
           in abundance.

14:009:028 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of
           all lands.

14:009:029 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they
           not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the
           prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo
           the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

14:009:030 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

14:009:031 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the
           city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
           stead.

14:010:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel
           come to make him king.

14:010:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
           in Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the
           king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

14:010:003 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came
           and spake to Rehoboam, saying,

14:010:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou
           somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy
           yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.

14:010:005 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days.
           And the people departed.

14:010:006 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
           before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What
           counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?

14:010:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this
           people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they
           will be thy servants for ever.

14:010:008 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and
           took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him,
           that stood before him.

14:010:009 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
           answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease
           somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?

14:010:010 And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto
           him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto
           thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
           somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My
           little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

14:010:011 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put
           more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I
           will chastise you with scorpions.

14:010:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
           day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third
           day.

14:010:013 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
           the counsel of the old men,

14:010:014 And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying,
           My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my
           father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
           scorpions.

14:010:015 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was
           of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake
           by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of
           Nebat.

14:010:016 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
           them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have
           we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse:
           every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to
           thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.

14:010:017 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
           Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

14:010:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
           the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
           But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to
           flee to Jerusalem.

14:010:019 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

14:011:001 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the
           house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand
           chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that
           he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.

14:011:002 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God,
           saying,

14:011:003 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to
           all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

14:011:004 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
           your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing
           is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and
           returned from going against Jeroboam.

14:011:005 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence
           in Judah.

14:011:006 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

14:011:007 And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,

14:011:008 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

14:011:009 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

14:011:010 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in
           Benjamin fenced cities.

14:011:011 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them,
           and store of victual, and of oil and wine.

14:011:012 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made
           them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

14:011:013 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel
           resorted to him out of all their coasts.

14:011:014 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
           came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had
           cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the
           LORD:

14:011:015 And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the
           devils, and for the calves which he had made.

14:011:016 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set
           their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem,
           to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.

14:011:017 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
           the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they
           walked in the way of David and Solomon.

14:011:018 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the
           son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the
           son of Jesse;

14:011:019 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.

14:011:020 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
           bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

14:011:021 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all
           his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and
           threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and
           threescore daughters.)

14:011:022 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be
           ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.

14:011:023 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
           throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every
           fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he
           desired many wives.

14:012:001 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the
           kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of
           the LORD, and all Israel with him.

14:012:002 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
           Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they
           had transgressed against the LORD,

14:012:003 With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand
           horsemen: and the people were without number that came with
           him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the
           Ethiopians.

14:012:004 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and
           came to Jerusalem.

14:012:005 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes
           of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of
           Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have
           forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of
           Shishak.

14:012:006 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled
           themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.

14:012:007 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word
           of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled
           themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will
           grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured
           out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

14:012:008 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
           service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

14:012:009 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took
           away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures
           of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the
           shields of gold which Solomon had made.

14:012:010 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
           committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that
           kept the entrance of the king's house.

14:012:011 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the
           guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the
           guard chamber.

14:012:012 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from
           him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in
           Judah things went well.

14:012:013 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and
           reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he
           began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,
           the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of
           Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was
           Naamah an Ammonitess.

14:012:014 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the
           LORD.

14:012:015 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
           in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer
           concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam
           and Jeroboam continually.

14:012:016 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
           city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

14:013:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
           reign over Judah.

14:013:002 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
           was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was
           war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

14:013:003 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men
           of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also
           set the battle in array against him with eight hundred
           thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.

14:013:004 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
           Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;

14:013:005 Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the
           kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his
           sons by a covenant of salt?

14:013:006 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
           of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.

14:013:007 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of
           Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the
           son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and
           could not withstand them.

14:013:008 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the
           hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and
           there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for
           gods.

14:013:009 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of
           Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the
           manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh
           to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the
           same may be a priest of them that are no gods.

14:013:010 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken
           him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the
           sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:

14:013:011 And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening
           burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set
           they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold
           with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the
           charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.

14:013:012 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his
           priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O
           children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your
           fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

14:013:013 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them:
           so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.

14:013:014 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
           behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded
           with the trumpets.

14:013:015 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
           shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all
           Israel before Abijah and Judah.

14:013:016 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God
           delivered them into their hand.

14:013:017 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so
           there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen
           men.

14:013:018 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
           and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon
           the LORD God of their fathers.

14:013:019 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
           Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns
           thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.

14:013:020 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
           Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.

14:013:021 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
           twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

14:013:022 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
           sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

14:014:001 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
           city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his
           days the land was quiet ten years.

14:014:002 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the
           LORD his God:

14:014:003 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high
           places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:

14:014:004 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and
           to do the law and the commandment.

14:014:005 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high
           places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.

14:014:006 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest,
           and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given
           him rest.

14:014:007 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and
           make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the
           land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our
           God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every
           side. So they built and prospered.

14:014:008 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out
           of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that
           bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore
           thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.

14:014:009 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
           host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and
           came unto Mareshah.

14:014:010 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in
           array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

14:014:011 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
           nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them
           that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on
           thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD,
           thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.

14:014:012 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
           and the Ethiopians fled.

14:014:013 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
           Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not
           recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD,
           and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.

14:014:014 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
           of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities;
           for there was exceeding much spoil in them.

14:014:015 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep
           and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

14:015:001 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

14:015:002 And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me,
           Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while
           ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you;
           but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.

14:015:003 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God,
           and without a teaching priest, and without law.

14:015:004 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
           Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

14:015:005 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out,
           nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the
           inhabitants of the countries.

14:015:006 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God
           did vex them with all adversity.

14:015:007 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for
           your work shall be rewarded.

14:015:008 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
           prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols
           out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
           cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the
           altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.

14:015:009 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with
           them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they
           fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the
           LORD his God was with him.

14:015:010 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
           month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

14:015:011 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil
           which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
           sheep.

14:015:012 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
           fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

14:015:013 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be
           put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

14:015:014 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
           shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

14:015:015 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with
           all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and
           he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.

14:015:016 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
           removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in
           a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt
           it at the brook Kidron.

14:015:017 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
           nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

14:015:018 And he brought into the house of God the things that his
           father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated,
           silver, and gold, and vessels.

14:015:019 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
           the reign of Asa.

14:016:001 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king
           of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the
           intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of
           Judah.

14:016:002 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of
           the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to
           Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

14:016:003 There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my
           father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and
           gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he
           may depart from me.

14:016:004 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
           his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon,
           and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

14:016:005 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
           building of Ramah, and let his work cease.

14:016:006 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
           stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was
           building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

14:016:007 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
           and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of
           Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the
           host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.

14:016:008 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
           many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on
           the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.

14:016:009 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
           earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose
           heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
           therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

14:016:010 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison
           house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing.
           And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.

14:016:011 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
           written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

14:016:012 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
           in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his
           disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

14:016:013 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and
           fortieth year of his reign.

14:016:014 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made
           for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed
           which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices
           prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great
           burning for him.

14:017:001 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
           himself against Israel.

14:017:002 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and
           set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of
           Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.

14:017:003 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the
           first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;

14:017:004 But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his
           commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

14:017:005 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all
           Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and
           honour in abundance.

14:017:006 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover
           he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.

14:017:007 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,
           even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to
           Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

14:017:008 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah,
           and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and
           Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them
           Elishama and Jehoram, priests.

14:017:009 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the
           LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of
           Judah, and taught the people.

14:017:010 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the
           lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war
           against Jehoshaphat.

14:017:011 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
           tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven
           thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven
           hundred he goats.

14:017:012 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
           castles, and cities of store.

14:017:013 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men
           of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.

14:017:014 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
           their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the
           chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred
           thousand.

14:017:015 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
           hundred and fourscore thousand.

14:017:016 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
           offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred
           thousand mighty men of valour.

14:017:017 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
           armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.

14:017:018 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and
           fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.

14:017:019 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in
           the fenced cities throughout all Judah.

14:018:001 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
           affinity with Ahab.

14:018:002 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And
           Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the
           people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with
           him to Ramothgilead.

14:018:003 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
           Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I
           am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be
           with thee in the war.

14:018:004 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
           thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

14:018:005 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets
           four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to
           Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
           up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.

14:018:006 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
           besides, that we might enquire of him?

14:018:007 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
           man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for
           he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is
           Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the
           king say so.

14:018:008 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and
           said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

14:018:009 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat
           either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they
           sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria;
           and all the prophets prophesied before them.

14:018:010 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
           and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push
           Syria until they be consumed.

14:018:011 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
           Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
           the hand of the king.

14:018:012 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
           saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the
           king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be
           like one of their's, and speak thou good.

14:018:013 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,
           that will I speak.

14:018:014 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
           Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I
           forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be
           delivered into your hand.

14:018:015 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
           that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the
           LORD?

14:018:016 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the
           mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said,
           These have no master; let them return therefore every man to
           his house in peace.

14:018:017 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
           thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

14:018:018 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the
           LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven
           standing on his right hand and on his left.

14:018:019 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that
           he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying
           after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

14:018:020 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
           said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him,
           Wherewith?

14:018:021 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth
           of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him,
           and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.

14:018:022 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
           mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
           against thee.

14:018:023 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote
           Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of
           the LORD from me to speak unto thee?

14:018:024 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou
           shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

14:018:025 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
           back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
           son;

14:018:026 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
           and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
           affliction, until I return in peace.

14:018:027 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
           not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye
           people.

14:018:028 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
           up to Ramothgilead.

14:018:029 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
           myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy
           robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went
           to the battle.

14:018:030 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the
           chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small
           or great, save only with the king of Israel.

14:018:031 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
           Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.
           Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat
           cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to
           depart from him.

14:018:032 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
           perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back
           again from pursuing him.

14:018:033 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
           of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said
           to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me
           out of the host; for I am wounded.

14:018:034 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
           stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the
           even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

14:019:001 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
           peace to Jerusalem.

14:019:002 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
           said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and
           love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee
           from before the LORD.

14:019:003 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
           hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared
           thine heart to seek God.

14:019:004 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again
           through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and
           brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.

14:019:005 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities
           of Judah, city by city,

14:019:006 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not
           for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.

14:019:007 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed
           and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor
           respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.

14:019:008 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and
           of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for
           the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they
           returned to Jerusalem.

14:019:009 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of
           the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

14:019:010 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
           dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and
           commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them
           that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come
           upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not
           trespass.

14:019:011 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all
           matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the
           ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also
           the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously,
           and the LORD shall be with the good.

14:020:001 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab,
           and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the
           Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

14:020:002 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There
           cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on
           this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which
           is Engedi.

14:020:003 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
           proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

14:020:004 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the
           LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek
           the LORD.

14:020:005 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and
           Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,

14:020:006 And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in
           heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the
           heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so
           that none is able to withstand thee?

14:020:007 Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of
           this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed
           of Abraham thy friend for ever?

14:020:008 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary
           therein for thy name, saying,

14:020:009 If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or
           pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy
           presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee
           in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

14:020:010 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount
           Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came
           out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and
           destroyed them not;

14:020:011 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of
           thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

14:020:012 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
           against this great company that cometh against us; neither
           know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.

14:020:013 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,
           their wives, and their children.

14:020:014 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,
           the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons
           of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the
           congregation;

14:020:015 And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of
           Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto
           you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great
           multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

14:020:016 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the
           cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook,
           before the wilderness of Jeruel.

14:020:017 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves,
           stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O
           Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go
           out against them: for the LORD will be with you.

14:020:018 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground:
           and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the
           LORD, worshipping the LORD.

14:020:019 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
           children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of
           Israel with a loud voice on high.

14:020:020 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
           wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood
           and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem;
           Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established;
           believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.

14:020:021 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed
           singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of
           holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise
           the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.

14:020:022 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
           ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount
           Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

14:020:023 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
           inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them:
           and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
           every one helped to destroy another.

14:020:024 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
           they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead
           bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.

14:020:025 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the
           spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches
           with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped
           off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they
           were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.

14:020:026 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley
           of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the
           name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah,
           unto this day.

14:020:027 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
           Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem
           with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their
           enemies.

14:020:028 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
           trumpets unto the house of the LORD.

14:020:029 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those
           countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against
           the enemies of Israel.

14:020:030 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him
           rest round about.

14:020:031 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five
           years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and
           five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the
           daughter of Shilhi.

14:020:032 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not
           from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.

14:020:033 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
           people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their
           fathers.

14:020:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,
           behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of
           Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

14:020:035 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
           Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

14:020:036 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to
           Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.

14:020:037 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
           Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with
           Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were
           broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

14:021:001 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
           his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned
           in his stead.

14:021:002 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and
           Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and
           Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of
           Israel.

14:021:003 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
           and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the
           kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.

14:021:004 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
           strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the
           sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.

14:021:005 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign,
           and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

14:021:006 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did
           the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife:
           and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.

14:021:007 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because
           of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he
           promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.

14:021:008 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
           Judah, and made themselves a king.

14:021:009 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
           with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites
           which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.

14:021:010 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto
           this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his
           hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.

14:021:011 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
           caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and
           compelled Judah thereto.

14:021:012 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,
           saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because
           thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father,
           nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

14:021:013 But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast
           made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring,
           like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast
           slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better
           than thyself:

14:021:014 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people,
           and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

14:021:015 And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels,
           until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by
           day.

14:021:016 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
           Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the
           Ethiopians:

14:021:017 And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried
           away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and
           his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son
           left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

14:021:018 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
           incurable disease.

14:021:019 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of
           two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so
           he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for
           him, like the burning of his fathers.

14:021:020 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
           reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being
           desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not
           in the sepulchres of the kings.

14:022:001 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
           king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the
           Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the
           son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.

14:022:002 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign,
           and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
           was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.

14:022:003 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his
           mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.

14:022:004 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house
           of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his
           father to his destruction.

14:022:005 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the
           son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria
           at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.

14:022:006 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
           which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king
           of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went
           down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was
           sick.

14:022:007 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram:
           for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu
           the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the
           house of Ahab.

14:022:008 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment
           upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and
           the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to
           Ahaziah, he slew them.

14:022:009 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
           Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain
           him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of
           Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the
           house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.

14:022:010 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
           dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house
           of Judah.

14:022:011 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
           of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were
           slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So
           Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
           Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid
           him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.

14:022:012 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
           Athaliah reigned over the land.

14:023:001 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and
           took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and
           Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and
           Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
           into covenant with him.

14:023:002 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of
           all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of
           Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

14:023:003 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
           house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son
           shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.

14:023:004 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you
           entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,
           shall be porters of the doors;

14:023:005 And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third
           part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall
           be in the courts of the house of the LORD.

14:023:006 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the
           priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go
           in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch
           of the LORD.

14:023:007 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
           with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into
           the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king
           when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.

14:023:008 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
           Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men
           that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go
           out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the
           courses.

14:023:009 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
           hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king
           David's, which were in the house of God.

14:023:010 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
           hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of
           the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king
           round about.

14:023:011 Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the
           crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And
           Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the
           king.

14:023:012 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
           praising the king, she came to the people into the house of
           the LORD:

14:023:013 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at
           the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
           and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with
           trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and
           such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes,
           and said, Treason, Treason.

14:023:014 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
           that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her
           forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain
           with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house
           of the LORD.

14:023:015 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the
           entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her
           there.

14:023:016 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
           people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's
           people.

14:023:017 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
           down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew
           Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

14:023:018 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD
           by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had
           distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt
           offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses,
           with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.

14:023:019 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
           that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.

14:023:020 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
           governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and
           brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they
           came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the
           king upon the throne of the kingdom.

14:023:021 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was
           quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

14:024:001 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
           Zibiah of Beersheba.

14:024:002 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
           all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

14:024:003 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
           daughters.

14:024:004 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to
           repair the house of the LORD.

14:024:005 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said
           to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all
           Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to
           year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites
           hastened it not.

14:024:006 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
           Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of
           Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the
           commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the
           congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?

14:024:007 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the
           house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house
           of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.

14:024:008 And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it
           without at the gate of the house of the LORD.

14:024:009 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
           bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of
           God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.

14:024:010 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought
           in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

14:024:011 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
           unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when
           they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the
           high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it,
           and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day,
           and gathered money in abundance.

14:024:012 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of
           the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and
           carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as
           wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.

14:024:013 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them,
           and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened
           it.

14:024:014 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the
           money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels
           for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to
           offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And
           they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD
           continually all the days of Jehoiada.

14:024:015 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
           hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.

14:024:016 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
           because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and
           toward his house.

14:024:017 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
           made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

14:024:018 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and
           served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and
           Jerusalem for this their trespass.

14:024:019 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the
           LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give
           ear.

14:024:020 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
           the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them,
           Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the
           LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the
           LORD, he hath also forsaken you.

14:024:021 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
           the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the
           LORD.

14:024:022 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
           his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he
           died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.

14:024:023 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
           Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and
           Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from
           among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king
           of Damascus.

14:024:024 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
           and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand,
           because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So
           they executed judgment against Joash.

14:024:025 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
           great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for
           the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on
           his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of
           David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.

14:024:026 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son
           of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a
           Moabitess.

14:024:027 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid
           upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they
           are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah
           his son reigned in his stead.

14:025:001 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
           and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

14:025:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but
           not with a perfect heart.

14:025:003 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
           that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

14:025:004 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in
           the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded,
           saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither
           shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall
           die for his own sin.

14:025:005 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them
           captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according
           to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and
           Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and
           above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able
           to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

14:025:006 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
           Israel for an hundred talents of silver.

14:025:007 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not
           the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with
           Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.

14:025:008 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God
           shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to
           help, and to cast down.

14:025:009 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for
           the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?
           And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee
           much more than this.

14:025:010 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
           him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger
           was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in
           great anger.

14:025:011 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people,
           and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of
           Seir ten thousand.

14:025:012 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
           carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock,
           and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all
           were broken in pieces.

14:025:013 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that
           they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of
           Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three
           thousand of them, and took much spoil.

14:025:014 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
           slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the
           children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed
           down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.

14:025:015 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah,
           and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast
           thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not
           deliver their own people out of thine hand?

14:025:016 And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said
           unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why
           shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said,
           I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou
           hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

14:025:017 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the
           son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,
           Come, let us see one another in the face.

14:025:018 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
           saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
           was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
           and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
           trode down the thistle.

14:025:019 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine
           heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why
           shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall,
           even thou, and Judah with thee?

14:025:020 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might
           deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they
           sought after the gods of Edom.

14:025:021 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another
           in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at
           Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

14:025:022 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
           every man to his tent.

14:025:023 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the
           son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought
           him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from
           the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

14:025:024 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
           that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the
           treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned
           to Samaria.

14:025:025 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
           death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

14:025:026 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
           are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and
           Israel?

14:025:027 Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
           the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and
           he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and
           slew him there.

14:025:028 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
           fathers in the city of Judah.

14:026:001 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen
           years old, and made him king in the room of his father
           Amaziah.

14:026:002 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
           slept with his fathers.

14:026:003 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
           reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
           also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

14:026:004 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his father Amaziah did.

14:026:005 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had
           understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought
           the LORD, God made him to prosper.

14:026:006 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and
           brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the
           wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the
           Philistines.

14:026:007 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
           Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.

14:026:008 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
           abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened
           himself exceedingly.

14:026:009 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,
           and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and
           fortified them.

14:026:010 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
           he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the
           plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains,
           and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.

14:026:011 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
           war by bands, according to the number of their account by the
           hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the
           hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.

14:026:012 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
           of valour were two thousand and six hundred.

14:026:013 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
           seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty
           power, to help the king against the enemy.

14:026:014 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
           and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings
           to cast stones.

14:026:015 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to
           be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and
           great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he
           was marvellously helped, till he was strong.

14:026:016 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
           destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and
           went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the
           altar of incense.

14:026:017 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him
           fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:

14:026:018 And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
           appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the
           LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are
           consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou
           hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the
           LORD God.

14:026:019 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
           incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy
           even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house
           of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.

14:026:020 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
           him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they
           thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go
           out, because the LORD had smitten him.

14:026:021 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
           dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off
           from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the
           king's house, judging the people of the land.

14:026:022 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
           the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

14:026:023 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
           fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the
           kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son
           reigned in his stead.

14:027:001 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
           and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
           also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.

14:027:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he
           entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did
           yet corruptly.

14:027:003 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the
           wall of Ophel he built much.

14:027:004 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
           forests he built castles and towers.

14:027:005 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
           against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year
           an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of
           wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of
           Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.

14:027:006 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before
           the LORD his God.

14:027:007 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
           ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel
           and Judah.

14:027:008 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
           reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

14:027:009 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
           city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

14:028:001 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which
           was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:

14:028:002 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made
           also molten images for Baalim.

14:028:003 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
           and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of
           the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of
           Israel.

14:028:004 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and
           on the hills, and under every green tree.

14:028:005 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
           king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great
           multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And
           he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who
           smote him with a great slaughter.

14:028:006 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and
           twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men;
           because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

14:028:007 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's
           son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that
           was next to the king.

14:028:008 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their
           brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and
           took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to
           Samaria.

14:028:009 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and
           he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said
           unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was
           wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and
           ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.

14:028:010 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
           Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there
           not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?

14:028:011 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which
           ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath
           of the LORD is upon you.

14:028:012 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
           the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and
           Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,
           stood up against them that came from the war,

14:028:013 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither:
           for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye
           intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our
           trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

14:028:014 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
           princes and all the congregation.

14:028:015 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
           captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among
           them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat
           and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of
           them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm
           trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.

14:028:016 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
           help him.

14:028:017 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried
           away captives.

14:028:018 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low
           country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh,
           and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages
           thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and
           the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.

14:028:019 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
           for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the
           LORD.

14:028:020 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
           distressed him, but strengthened him not.

14:028:021 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and
           out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it
           unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.

14:028:022 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more
           against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.

14:028:023 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:
           and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,
           therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But
           they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.

14:028:024 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
           and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up
           the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in
           every corner of Jerusalem.

14:028:025 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
           incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of
           his fathers.

14:028:026 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
           behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and
           Israel.

14:028:027 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
           city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the
           sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son
           reigned in his stead.

14:029:001 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,
           and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

14:029:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that David his father had done.

14:029:003 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened
           the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.

14:029:004 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered
           them together into the east street,

14:029:005 And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now
           yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your
           fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.

14:029:006 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil
           in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and
           have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD,
           and turned their backs.

14:029:007 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
           lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings
           in the holy place unto the God of Israel.

14:029:008 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem,
           and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to
           hissing, as ye see with your eyes.

14:029:009 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons
           and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

14:029:010 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God
           of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

14:029:011 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
           stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister
           unto him, and burn incense.

14:029:012 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
           son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons
           of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of
           Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and
           Eden the son of Joah:

14:029:013 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the
           sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:

14:029:014 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons
           of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.

14:029:015 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves,
           and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the
           words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.

14:029:016 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
           LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that
           they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the
           house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out
           abroad into the brook Kidron.

14:029:017 Now they began on the first day of the first month to
           sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the
           porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in
           eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they
           made an end.

14:029:018 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
           cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt
           offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread
           table, with all the vessels thereof.

14:029:019 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did
           cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and
           sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the
           LORD.

14:029:020 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
           the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.

14:029:021 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
           lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom,
           and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the
           priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the
           LORD.

14:029:022 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the
           blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had
           killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they
           killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the
           altar.

14:029:023 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering
           before the king and the congregation; and they laid their
           hands upon them:

14:029:024 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
           their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all
           Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the
           sin offering should be made for all Israel.

14:029:025 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
           with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment
           of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet:
           for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.

14:029:026 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
           priests with the trumpets.

14:029:027 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
           altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD
           began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments
           ordained by David king of Israel.

14:029:028 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
           the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt
           offering was finished.

14:029:029 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all
           that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.

14:029:030 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the
           Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David,
           and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness,
           and they bowed their heads and worshipped.

14:029:031 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
           yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and
           thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the
           congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as
           many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.

14:029:032 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
           brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and
           two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the
           LORD.

14:029:033 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
           thousand sheep.

14:029:034 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
           the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did
           help them, till the work was ended, and until the other
           priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more
           upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

14:029:035 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat
           of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every
           burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was
           set in order.

14:029:036 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had
           prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

14:030:001 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters
           also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the
           house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the
           LORD God of Israel.

14:030:002 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
           congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second
           month.

14:030:003 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
           had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the
           people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.

14:030:004 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.

14:030:005 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout
           all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come
           to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem:
           for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was
           written.

14:030:006 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
           princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the
           commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn
           again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he
           will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the
           hand of the kings of Assyria.

14:030:007 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
           trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who
           therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.

14:030:008 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
           yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which
           he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that
           the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.

14:030:009 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
           children shall find compassion before them that lead them
           captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the
           LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away
           his face from you, if ye return unto him.

14:030:010 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
           Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them
           to scorn, and mocked them.

14:030:011 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
           humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.

14:030:012 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
           the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of
           the LORD.

14:030:013 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
           of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great
           congregation.

14:030:014 And they arose and took away the altars that were in
           Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and
           cast them into the brook Kidron.

14:030:015 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
           second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
           and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings
           into the house of the LORD.

14:030:016 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
           the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the
           blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.

14:030:017 For there were many in the congregation that were not
           sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the
           killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to
           sanctify them unto the LORD.

14:030:018 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
           Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,
           yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.
           But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon
           every one

14:030:019 That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his
           fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the
           purification of the sanctuary.

14:030:020 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

14:030:021 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
           the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness:
           and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day,
           singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.

14:030:022 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that
           taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat
           throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and
           making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.

14:030:023 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
           and they kept other seven days with gladness.

14:030:024 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
           thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes
           gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand
           sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.

14:030:025 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
           Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and
           the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that
           dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

14:030:026 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
           Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like
           in Jerusalem.

14:030:027 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
           their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy
           dwelling place, even unto heaven.

14:031:001 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present
           went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in
           pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high
           places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in
           Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed
           them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man
           to his possession, into their own cities.

14:031:002 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the
           Levites after their courses, every man according to his
           service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for
           peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to
           praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

14:031:003 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the
           burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt
           offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for
           the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the
           law of the LORD.

14:031:004 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to
           give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they
           might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.

14:031:005 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
           Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and
           oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the
           tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.

14:031:006 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
           the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen
           and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated
           unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.

14:031:007 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the
           heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.

14:031:008 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
           blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.

14:031:009 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
           concerning the heaps.

14:031:010 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered
           him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings
           into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and
           have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and
           that which is left is this great store.

14:031:011 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of
           the LORD; and they prepared them,

14:031:012 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
           things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler,
           and Shimei his brother was the next.

14:031:013 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
           and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and
           Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei
           his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and
           Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

14:031:014 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
           east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute
           the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.

14:031:015 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and
           Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the
           priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by
           courses, as well to the great as to the small:

14:031:016 Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and
           upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of
           the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges
           according to their courses;

14:031:017 Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their
           fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in
           their charges by their courses;

14:031:018 And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives,
           and their sons, and their daughters, through all the
           congregation: for in their set office they sanctified
           themselves in holiness:

14:031:019 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the
           fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city,
           the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all
           the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by
           genealogies among the Levites.

14:031:020 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
           which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

14:031:021 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
           God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God,
           he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

14:032:001 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
           king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped
           against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for
           himself.

14:032:002 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he
           was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

14:032:003 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
           the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and
           they did help him.

14:032:004 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all
           the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the
           land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find
           much water?

14:032:005 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that
           was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall
           without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made
           darts and shields in abundance.

14:032:006 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
           together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and
           spake comfortably to them, saying,

14:032:007 Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the
           king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him:
           for there be more with us than with him:

14:032:008 With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God
           to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested
           themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

14:032:009 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
           to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and
           all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto
           all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,

14:032:010 Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust,
           that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

14:032:011 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die
           by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall
           deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

14:032:012 Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his
           altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall
           worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?

14:032:013 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the
           people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those
           lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?

14:032:014 Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my
           fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out
           of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out
           of mine hand?

14:032:015 Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you
           on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any
           nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine
           hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall
           your God deliver you out of mine hand?

14:032:016 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and
           against his servant Hezekiah.

14:032:017 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and
           to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of
           other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand,
           so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of
           mine hand.

14:032:018 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the
           people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them,
           and to trouble them; that they might take the city.

14:032:019 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the
           gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the
           hands of man.

14:032:020 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah
           the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

14:032:021 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men
           of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the
           king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own
           land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they
           that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the
           sword.

14:032:022 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
           from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the
           hand of all other, and guided them on every side.

14:032:023 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and
           presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified
           in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.

14:032:024 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
           the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

14:032:025 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
           unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was
           wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

14:032:026 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
           heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the
           wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

14:032:027 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
           himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious
           stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of
           pleasant jewels;

14:032:028 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil;
           and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

14:032:029 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
           herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

14:032:030 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of
           Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
           city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

14:032:031 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
           Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was
           done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know
           all that was in his heart.

14:032:032 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness,
           behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet,
           the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and
           Israel.

14:032:033 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
           the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all
           Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his
           death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

14:033:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:

14:033:002 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like
           unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast
           out before the children of Israel.

14:033:003 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
           had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made
           groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served
           them.

14:033:004 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the
           LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.

14:033:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
           courts of the house of the LORD.

14:033:006 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the
           valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used
           enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar
           spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of
           the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

14:033:007 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
           house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon
           his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
           before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

14:033:008 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of
           the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they
           will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according
           to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the
           hand of Moses.

14:033:009 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to
           err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had
           destroyed before the children of Israel.

14:033:010 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
           would not hearken.

14:033:011 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host
           of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns,
           and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

14:033:012 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God,
           and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

14:033:013 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard
           his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his
           kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.

14:033:014 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on
           the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in
           at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up
           a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced
           cities of Judah.

14:033:015 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the
           house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the
           mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast
           them out of the city.

14:033:016 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
           peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to
           serve the LORD God of Israel.

14:033:017 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high
           places, yet unto the LORD their God only.

14:033:018 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
           God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name
           of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the
           book of the kings of Israel.

14:033:019 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
           sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high
           places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was
           humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the
           seers.

14:033:020 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
           own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

14:033:021 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
           reigned two years in Jerusalem.

14:033:022 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
           did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the
           carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served
           them;

14:033:023 And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his
           father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

14:033:024 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his
           own house.

14:033:025 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
           against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
           son king in his stead.

14:034:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.

14:034:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
           walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither
           to the right hand, nor to the left.

14:034:003 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
           he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the
           twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the
           high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the
           molten images.

14:034:004 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and
           the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the
           groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake
           in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the
           graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

14:034:005 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and
           cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

14:034:006 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and
           Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

14:034:007 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had
           beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the
           idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to
           Jerusalem.

14:034:008 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
           the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah,
           and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of
           Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.

14:034:009 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered
           the money that was brought into the house of God, which the
           Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of
           Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of
           all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.

14:034:010 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
           oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the
           workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and
           amend the house:

14:034:011 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
           stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which
           the kings of Judah had destroyed.

14:034:012 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them
           were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari;
           and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to
           set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill
           of instruments of musick.

14:034:013 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers
           of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of
           the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

14:034:014 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
           house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law
           of the LORD given by Moses.

14:034:015 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have
           found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
           Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

14:034:016 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king
           word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy
           servants, they do it.

14:034:017 And they have gathered together the money that was found in
           the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of
           the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

14:034:018 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the
           priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the
           king.

14:034:019 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
           law, that he rent his clothes.

14:034:020 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
           and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah
           a servant of the king's, saying,

14:034:021 Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in
           Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is
           found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out
           upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the
           LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

14:034:022 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to
           Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath,
           the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
           Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that
           effect.

14:034:023 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
           ye the man that sent you to me,

14:034:024 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
           place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses
           that are written in the book which they have read before the
           king of Judah:

14:034:025 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
           other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
           works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out
           upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

14:034:026 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
           LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
           Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;

14:034:027 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself
           before God, when thou heardest his words against this place,
           and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself
           before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I
           have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.

14:034:028 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
           gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see
           all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the
           inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.

14:034:029 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of
           Judah and Jerusalem.

14:034:030 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
           men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
           priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small:
           and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the
           covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.

14:034:031 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before
           the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his
           commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all
           his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the
           covenant which are written in this book.

14:034:032 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin
           to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according
           to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

14:034:033 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
           countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made
           all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the
           LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from
           following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

14:035:001 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:
           and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
           first month.

14:035:002 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them
           to the service of the house of the LORD,

14:035:003 And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were
           holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which
           Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall
           not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your
           God, and his people Israel,

14:035:004 And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after
           your courses, according to the writing of David king of
           Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.

14:035:005 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
           families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after
           the division of the families of the Levites.

14:035:006 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare
           your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the
           LORD by the hand of Moses.

14:035:007 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids,
           all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to
           the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks:
           these were of the king's substance.

14:035:008 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the
           priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel,
           rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the
           passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle
           and three hundred oxen.

14:035:009 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
           Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave
           unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small
           cattle, and five hundred oxen.

14:035:010 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
           place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the
           king's commandment.

14:035:011 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the
           blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.

14:035:012 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
           according to the divisions of the families of the people, to
           offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses.
           And so did they with the oxen.

14:035:013 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
           ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and
           in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all
           the people.

14:035:014 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
           priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in
           offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore
           the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the
           sons of Aaron.

14:035:015 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place,
           according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman,
           and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every
           gate; they might not depart from their service; for their
           brethren the Levites prepared for them.

14:035:016 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to
           keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar
           of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.

14:035:017 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover
           at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

14:035:018 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
           days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of
           Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests,
           and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present,
           and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

14:035:019 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this
           passover kept.

14:035:020 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho
           king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by
           Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.

14:035:021 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with
           thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day,
           but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded
           me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is
           with me, that he destroy thee not.

14:035:022 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but
           disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened
           not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to
           fight in the valley of Megiddo.

14:035:023 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
           servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

14:035:024 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put
           him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to
           Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the
           sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned
           for Josiah.

14:035:025 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and
           the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to
           this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold,
           they are written in the lamentations.

14:035:026 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness,
           according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,

14:035:027 And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the
           book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

14:036:001 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
           and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.

14:036:002 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
           reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

14:036:003 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned
           the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

14:036:004 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
           and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho
           took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.

14:036:005 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
           reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did
           that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.

14:036:006 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound
           him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

14:036:007 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the
           LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

14:036:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
           which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they
           are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and
           Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

14:036:009 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did
           that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.

14:036:010 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and
           brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house
           of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and
           Jerusalem.

14:036:011 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
           and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

14:036:012 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his
           God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet
           speaking from the mouth of the LORD.

14:036:013 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
           him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his
           heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.

14:036:014 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
           transgressed very much after all the abominations of the
           heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had
           hallowed in Jerusalem.

14:036:015 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his
           messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had
           compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:

14:036:016 But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
           and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose
           against his people, till there was no remedy.

14:036:017 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who
           slew their young men with the sword in the house of their
           sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old
           man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his
           hand.

14:036:018 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and
           the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
           the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.

14:036:019 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
           Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and
           destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.

14:036:020 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
           Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until
           the reign of the kingdom of Persia:

14:036:021 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until
           the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay
           desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.

14:036:022 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
           of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
           accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
           Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his
           kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

14:036:023 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
           hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me
           to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is
           there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with
           him, and let him go up.

Book 15        Ezra

15:001:001 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
           of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the
           LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he
           made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it
           also in writing, saying,

15:001:002 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath
           given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me
           to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

15:001:003 Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him,
           and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build
           the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is
           in Jerusalem.

15:001:004 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let
           the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and
           with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for
           the house of God that is in Jerusalem.

15:001:005 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,
           and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit
           God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which
           is in Jerusalem.

15:001:006 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands
           with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with
           beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was
           willingly offered.

15:001:007 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of
           the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of
           Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;

15:001:008 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of
           Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar,
           the prince of Judah.

15:001:009 And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a
           thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,

15:001:010 Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four
           hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.

15:001:011 All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and
           four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of
           the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto
           Jerusalem.

15:002:001 Now these are the children of the province that went up out of
           the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom
           Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto
           Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one
           unto his city;

15:002:002 Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,
           Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.
           The number of the men of the people of Israel:

           two.

15:002:052 The children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children
           of Harsha,

15:002:053 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children
           of Thamah,

15:002:054 The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

15:002:055 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
           children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda,

15:002:056 The children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children

15:002:057 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the

15:002:058 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
           were three hundred ninety and two.

15:002:059 And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa,
           Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their
           father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:

15:002:060 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
           of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.

15:002:061 And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah,
           the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a
           wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was
           called after their name:

15:002:062 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
           genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as
           polluted, put from the priesthood.

15:002:063 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
           the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
           and with Thummim.

15:002:064 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
           three hundred and threescore,

15:002:065 Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were
           seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were
           among them two hundred singing men and singing women.

15:002:066 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules,
           two hundred forty and five;

15:002:067 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six
           thousand seven hundred and twenty.

15:002:068 And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the
           house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for
           the house of God to set it up in his place:

15:002:069 They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
           threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand
           pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.

15:002:070 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and
           the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in
           their cities, and all Israel in their cities.

15:003:001 And when the seventh month was come, and the children of
           Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves
           together as one man to Jerusalem.

15:003:002 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the
           priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his
           brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer
           burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses
           the man of God.

15:003:003 And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them
           because of the people of those countries: and they offered
           burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings
           morning and evening.

15:003:004 They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and
           offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the
           custom, as the duty of every day required;

15:003:005 And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of
           the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were
           consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a
           freewill offering unto the LORD.

15:003:006 From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer
           burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the
           temple of the LORD was not yet laid.

15:003:007 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters;
           and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them
           of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of
           Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of
           Persia.

15:003:008 Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God
           at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of
           Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of
           their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that
           were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed
           the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward
           the work of the house of the LORD.

15:003:009 Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and
           his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the
           workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their
           sons and their brethren the Levites.

15:003:010 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the
           LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and
           the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the
           LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.

15:003:011 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks
           unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for
           ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great
           shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of
           the house of the LORD was laid.

15:003:012 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers,
           who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the
           foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with
           a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:

15:003:013 So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of
           joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the
           people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar
           off.

15:004:001 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
           children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God
           of Israel;

15:004:002 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers,
           and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your
           God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of
           Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.

15:004:003 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the
           fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with
           us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together
           will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king
           of Persia hath commanded us.

15:004:004 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people
           of Judah, and troubled them in building,

15:004:005 And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their
           purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the
           reign of Darius king of Persia.

15:004:006 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,
           wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of
           Judah and Jerusalem.

15:004:007 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath,
           Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king
           of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the
           Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.

15:004:008 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
           against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

15:004:009 Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and
           the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the
           Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the
           Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites,
           and the Elamites,

15:004:010 And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper
           brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest
           that are on this side the river, and at such a time.

15:004:011 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even
           unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side
           the river, and at such a time.

15:004:012 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from
           thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious
           and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and
           joined the foundations.

15:004:013 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded,
           and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll,
           tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of
           the kings.

15:004:014 Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it
           was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore
           have we sent and certified the king;

15:004:015 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy
           fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and
           know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto
           kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within
           the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.

15:004:016 We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and
           the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no
           portion on this side the river.

15:004:017 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
           Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that
           dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace,
           and at such a time.

15:004:018 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before
           me.

15:004:019 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found
           that this city of old time hath made insurrection against
           kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.

15:004:020 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have
           ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute,
           and custom, was paid unto them.

15:004:021 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that
           this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be
           given from me.

15:004:022 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage
           grow to the hurt of the kings?

15:004:023 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before
           Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they
           went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to
           cease by force and power.

15:004:024 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at
           Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of
           Darius king of Persia.

15:005:001 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son
           of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and
           Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.

15:005:002 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the
           son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is
           at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping
           them.

15:005:003 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side
           the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said
           thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house,
           and to make up this wall?

15:005:004 Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names
           of the men that make this building?

15:005:005 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that
           they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to
           Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning
           this matter.

15:005:006 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
           river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites,
           which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:

15:005:007 They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto
           Darius the king, all peace.

15:005:008 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of
           Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with
           great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work
           goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.

15:005:009 Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who
           commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?

15:005:010 We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might
           write the names of the men that were the chief of them.

15:005:011 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants
           of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was
           builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel
           builded and set up.

15:005:012 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto
           wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
           of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and
           carried the people away into Babylon.

15:005:013 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same
           king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.

15:005:014 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
           which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in
           Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those
           did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they
           were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he
           had made governor;

15:005:015 And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the
           temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be
           builded in his place.

15:005:016 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the
           house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even
           until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not
           finished.

15:005:017 Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be
           search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at
           Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the
           king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king
           send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

15:006:001 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the
           house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in
           Babylon.

15:006:002 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the
           province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus
           written:

15:006:003 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king
           made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let
           the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices,
           and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height
           thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore
           cubits;

15:006:004 With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and
           let the expenses be given out of the king's house:

15:006:005 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of
           God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which
           is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and
           brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one
           to his place, and place them in the house of God.

15:006:006 Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river,
           Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which
           are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:

15:006:007 Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of
           the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in
           his place.

15:006:008 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of
           these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the
           king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith
           expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.

15:006:009 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and
           rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven,
           wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of
           the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day
           by day without fail:

15:006:010 That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God
           of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.

15:006:011 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this
           word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set
           up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a
           dunghill for this.

15:006:012 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy
           all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter
           and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I
           Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.

15:006:013 Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai,
           and their companions, according to that which Darius the king
           had sent, so they did speedily.

15:006:014 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through
           the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of
           Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the
           commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the
           commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of
           Persia.

15:006:015 And this house was finished on the third day of the month
           Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the
           king.

15:006:016 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and
           the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication
           of this house of God with joy.

15:006:017 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
           bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin
           offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the
           number of the tribes of Israel.

15:006:018 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites
           in their courses, for the service of God, which is at
           Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.

15:006:019 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
           fourteenth day of the first month.

15:006:020 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of
           them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children
           of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for
           themselves.

15:006:021 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of
           captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them
           from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the
           LORD God of Israel, did eat,

15:006:022 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
           for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the
           king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the
           work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

15:007:001 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of
           Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son
           of Hilkiah,

15:007:002 The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

15:007:003 The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,

15:007:004 The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,

15:007:005 The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
           the son of Aaron the chief priest:

15:007:006 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in
           the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and
           the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of
           the LORD his God upon him.

15:007:007 And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the
           priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters,
           and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of
           Artaxerxes the king.

15:007:008 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the
           seventh year of the king.

15:007:009 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up
           from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he
           to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.

15:007:010 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD,
           and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

15:007:011 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes
           gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the
           words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to
           Israel.

15:007:012 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of
           the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a
           time.

15:007:013 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of
           his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of
           their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.

15:007:014 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven
           counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
           according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;

15:007:015 And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his
           counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose
           habitation is in Jerusalem,

15:007:016 And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the
           province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people,
           and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their
           God which is in Jerusalem:

15:007:017 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams,
           lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings,
           and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which
           is in Jerusalem.

15:007:018 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren,
           to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after
           the will of your God.

15:007:019 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the
           house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of
           Jerusalem.

15:007:020 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,
           which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the
           king's treasure house.

15:007:021 And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
           treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra
           the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall
           require of you, it be done speedily,

15:007:022 Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures
           of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred
           baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.

15:007:023 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be
           diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why
           should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his
           sons?

15:007:024 Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and
           Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this
           house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute,
           or custom, upon them.

15:007:025 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine
           hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the
           people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of
           thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.

15:007:026 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of
           the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether
           it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of
           goods, or to imprisonment.

15:007:027 Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a
           thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of
           the LORD which is in Jerusalem:

15:007:028 And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his
           counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I
           was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me,
           and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with
           me.

15:008:001 These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the
           genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the
           reign of Artaxerxes the king.

15:008:002 Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar;
           Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.

15:008:003 Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah:
           and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an
           hundred and fifty.

15:008:004 Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and
           with him two hundred males.

15:008:005 Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him
           three hundred males.

15:008:006 Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with
           him fifty males.

15:008:007 And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and
           with him seventy males.

15:008:008 And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael,
           and with him fourscore males.

15:008:009 Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him
           two hundred and eighteen males.

15:008:010 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with
           him an hundred and threescore males.

15:008:011 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with
           him twenty and eight males.

15:008:012 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and
           with him an hundred and ten males.

15:008:013 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,
           Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore
           males.

15:008:014 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
           seventy males.

15:008:015 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to
           Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed
           the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons
           of Levi.

15:008:016 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
           Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and
           for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib,
           and for Elnathan, men of understanding.

15:008:017 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the
           place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto
           Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place
           Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the
           house of our God.

15:008:018 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man
           of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the
           son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren,
           eighteen;

15:008:019 And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,
           his brethren and their sons, twenty;

15:008:020 Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had
           appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and
           twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.

15:008:021 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we
           might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right
           way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our
           substance.

15:008:022 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers
           and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because
           we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is
           upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his
           wrath is against all them that forsake him.

15:008:023 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was
           intreated of us.

15:008:024 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests,
           Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,

15:008:025 And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the
           vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the
           king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there
           present, had offered:

15:008:026 I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents
           of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold
           an hundred talents;

15:008:027 Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two
           vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.

15:008:028 And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels
           are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill
           offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.

15:008:029 Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief
           of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of
           Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the
           LORD.

15:008:030 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver,
           and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto
           the house of our God.

15:008:031 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
           the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God
           was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy,
           and of such as lay in wait by the way.

15:008:032 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.

15:008:033 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the
           vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of
           Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar
           the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of
           Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;

15:008:034 By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was
           written at that time.

15:008:035 Also the children of those that had been carried away, which
           were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto
           the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and
           six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin
           offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.

15:008:036 And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's
           lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and
           they furthered the people, and the house of God.

15:009:001 Now when these things were done, the princes came to me,
           saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the
           Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the
           lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the
           Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the
           Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.

15:009:002 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for
           their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with
           the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and
           rulers hath been chief in this trespass.

15:009:003 And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle,
           and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat
           down astonied.

15:009:004 Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the
           words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of
           those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the
           evening sacrifice.

15:009:005 And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and
           having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees,
           and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,

15:009:006 And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face
           to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our
           head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.

15:009:007 Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass
           unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and
           our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the
           lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to
           confusion of face, as it is this day.

15:009:008 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the
           LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us
           a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes,
           and give us a little reviving in our bondage.

15:009:009 For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
           bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the
           kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of
           our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us
           a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

15:009:010 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
           forsaken thy commandments,

15:009:011 Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets,
           saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an
           unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands,
           with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to
           another with their uncleanness.

15:009:012 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither
           take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or
           their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good
           of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
           for ever.

15:009:013 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for
           our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us
           less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such
           deliverance as this;

15:009:014 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity
           with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be
           angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there
           should be no remnant nor escaping?

15:009:015 O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet
           escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our
           trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

15:010:001 Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping
           and casting himself down before the house of God, there
           assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of
           men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.

15:010:002 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,
           answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our
           God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land:
           yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.

15:010:003 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away
           all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the
           counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the
           commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the
           law.

15:010:004 Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be
           with thee: be of good courage, and do it.

15:010:005 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and
           all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this
           word. And they sware.

15:010:006 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into
           the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came
           thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned
           because of the transgression of them that had been carried
           away.

15:010:007 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto
           all the children of the captivity, that they should gather
           themselves together unto Jerusalem;

15:010:008 And that whosoever would not come within three days, according
           to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his
           substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the
           congregation of those that had been carried away.

15:010:009 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
           together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth
           month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people
           sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of
           this matter, and for the great rain.

15:010:010 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
           transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the
           trespass of Israel.

15:010:011 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your
           fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the
           people of the land, and from the strange wives.

15:010:012 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
           As thou hast said, so must we do.

15:010:013 But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we
           are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one
           day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this
           thing.

15:010:014 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all
           them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at
           appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and
           the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this
           matter be turned from us.

15:010:015 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
           were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai
           the Levite helped them.

15:010:016 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,
           with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their
           fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and
           sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the
           matter.

15:010:017 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange
           wives by the first day of the first month.

15:010:018 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had
           taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of
           Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib,
           and Gedaliah.

15:010:019 And they gave their hands that they would put away their
           wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for
           their trespass.

15:010:020 And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.

15:010:021 And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,
           and Jehiel, and Uzziah.

15:010:022 And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael,
           Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

15:010:023 Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the
           same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

15:010:024 Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum,
           and Telem, and Uri.

15:010:025 Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah,
           and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and
           Benaiah.

15:010:026 And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and
           Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.

15:010:027 And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and
           Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.

15:010:028 Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and
           Athlai.

15:010:029 And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah,
           Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.

15:010:030 And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah,
           Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.

15:010:031 And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah,
           Shemaiah, Shimeon,

15:010:032 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.

15:010:033 Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet,
           Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.

15:010:034 Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,

15:010:035 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,

15:010:036 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

15:010:037 Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,

15:010:038 And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,

15:010:039 And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,

15:010:040 Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,

15:010:041 Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,

15:010:042 Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.

15:010:043 Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau,
           and Joel, Benaiah.

15:010:044 All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives
           by whom they had children.

Book 16        Nehemiah

16:001:001 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to
           pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in
           Shushan the palace,

16:001:002 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of
           Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
           which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

16:001:003 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the
           captivity there in the province are in great affliction and
           reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the
           gates thereof are burned with fire.

16:001:004 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down
           and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed
           before the God of heaven,

16:001:005 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and
           terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
           love him and observe his commandments:

16:001:006 Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou
           mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before
           thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy
           servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel,
           which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's
           house have sinned.

16:001:007 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept
           the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which
           thou commandedst thy servant Moses.

16:001:008 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
           servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you
           abroad among the nations:

16:001:009 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them;
           though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of
           the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring
           them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.

16:001:010 Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
           redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.

16:001:011 O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the
           prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who
           desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant
           this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I
           was the king's cupbearer.

16:002:001 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year
           of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took
           up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been
           beforetime sad in his presence.

16:002:002 Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
           seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of
           heart. Then I was very sore afraid,

16:002:003 And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should
           not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my
           fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are
           consumed with fire?

16:002:004 Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?
           So I prayed to the God of heaven.

16:002:005 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
           servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest
           send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres,
           that I may build it.

16:002:006 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)
           For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?
           So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.

16:002:007 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let
           letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that
           they may convey me over till I come into Judah;

16:002:008 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that
           he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the
           palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the
           city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king
           granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

16:002:009 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them
           the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army
           and horsemen with me.

16:002:010 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
           Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there
           was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

16:002:011 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.

16:002:012 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither
           told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at
           Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast
           that I rode upon.

16:002:013 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
           the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of
           Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were
           consumed with fire.

16:002:014 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's
           pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me
           to pass.

16:002:015 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
           and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so
           returned.

16:002:016 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither
           had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to
           the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the
           work.

16:002:017 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
           Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with
           fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we
           be no more a reproach.

16:002:018 Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me;
           as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they
           said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their
           hands for this good work.

16:002:019 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
           Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to
           scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye
           do? will ye rebel against the king?

16:002:020 Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven,
           he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and
           build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in
           Jerusalem.

16:003:001 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the
           priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it,
           and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they
           sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.

16:003:002 And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
           builded Zaccur the son of Imri.

16:003:003 But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also
           laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the
           locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

16:003:004 And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the
           son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of
           Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired
           Zadok the son of Baana.

16:003:005 And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put
           not their necks to the work of their LORD.

16:003:006 Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and
           Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof,
           and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the
           bars thereof.

16:003:007 And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon
           the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the
           throne of the governor on this side the river.

16:003:008 Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the
           goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of
           one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the
           broad wall.

16:003:009 And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler
           of the half part of Jerusalem.

16:003:010 And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even
           over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the
           son of Hashabniah.

16:003:011 Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab,
           repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.

16:003:012 And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the
           ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.

16:003:013 The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah;
           they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks
           thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the
           wall unto the dung gate.

16:003:014 But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the
           ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the
           doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

16:003:015 But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of
           Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and
           covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof,
           and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by
           the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the
           city of David.

16:003:016 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the
           half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the
           sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto
           the house of the mighty.

16:003:017 After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next
           unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of
           Keilah, in his part.

16:003:018 After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad,
           the ruler of the half part of Keilah.

16:003:019 And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of
           Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury
           at the turning of the wall.

16:003:020 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the
           other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the
           house of Eliashib the high priest.

16:003:021 After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz
           another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to
           the end of the house of Eliashib.

16:003:022 And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.

16:003:023 After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their
           house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son
           of Ananiah by his house.

16:003:024 After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece,
           from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even
           unto the corner.

16:003:025 Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall,
           and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that
           was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of
           Parosh.

16:003:026 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over
           against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that
           lieth out.

16:003:027 After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against
           the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.

16:003:028 From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over
           against his house.

16:003:029 After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his
           house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah,
           the keeper of the east gate.

16:003:030 After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun
           the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired
           Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.

16:003:031 After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place
           of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate
           Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.

16:003:032 And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate
           repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.

16:004:001 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded
           the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked
           the Jews.

16:004:002 And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
           said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves?
           will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they
           revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are
           burned?

16:004:003 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that
           which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down
           their stone wall.

16:004:004 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach
           upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of
           captivity:

16:004:005 And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted
           out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger
           before the builders.

16:004:006 So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together
           unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.

16:004:007 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
           Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that
           the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches
           began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,

16:004:008 And conspired all of them together to come and to fight
           against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.

16:004:009 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
           against them day and night, because of them.

16:004:010 And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
           decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to
           build the wall.

16:004:011 And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
           till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause
           the work to cease.

16:004:012 And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
           came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye
           shall return unto us they will be upon you.

16:004:013 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on
           the higher places, I even set the people after their families
           with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

16:004:014 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to
           the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of
           them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and
           fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your
           wives, and your houses.

16:004:015 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
           unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we
           returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.

16:004:016 And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
           servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held
           both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the
           habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.

16:004:017 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens,
           with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought
           in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.

16:004:018 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side,
           and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

16:004:019 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest
           of the people, The work is great and large, and we are
           separated upon the wall, one far from another.

16:004:020 In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
           resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.

16:004:021 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears
           from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.

16:004:022 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every
           one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night
           they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.

16:004:023 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of
           the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,
           saving that every one put them off for washing.

16:005:001 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives
           against their brethren the Jews.

16:005:002 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
           many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and
           live.

16:005:003 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
           vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the
           dearth.

16:005:004 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the
           king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.

16:005:005 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our
           children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our
           sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our
           daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in
           our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and
           vineyards.

16:005:006 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.

16:005:007 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and
           the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of
           his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.

16:005:008 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
           brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will
           ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us?
           Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.

16:005:009 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk
           in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen
           our enemies?

16:005:010 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of
           them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

16:005:011 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,
           their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the
           hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and
           the oil, that ye exact of them.

16:005:012 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing
           of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
           priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do
           according to this promise.

16:005:013 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
           his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this
           promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the
           congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people
           did according to this promise.

16:005:014 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their
           governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even
           unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that
           is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread
           of the governor.

16:005:015 But the former governors that had been before me were
           chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and
           wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants
           bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the
           fear of God.

16:005:016 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought
           we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto
           the work.

16:005:017 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the
           Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the
           heathen that are about us.

16:005:018 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
           choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten
           days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not
           I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy
           upon this people.

16:005:019 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have
           done for this people.

16:006:001 Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
           Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded
           the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though
           at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)

16:006:002 That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us
           meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono.
           But they thought to do me mischief.

16:006:003 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great
           work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,
           whilst I leave it, and come down to you?

16:006:004 Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I
           answered them after the same manner.

16:006:005 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the
           fifth time with an open letter in his hand;

16:006:006 Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and
           Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for
           which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their
           king, according to these words.

16:006:007 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
           Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it
           be reported to the king according to these words. Come now
           therefore, and let us take counsel together.

16:006:008 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as
           thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.

16:006:009 For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be
           weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O
           God, strengthen my hands.

16:006:010 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
           the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us
           meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let
           us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay
           thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

16:006:011 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there,
           that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his
           life? I will not go in.

16:006:012 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
           pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat
           had hired him.

16:006:013 Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so,
           and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report,
           that they might reproach me.

16:006:014 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to
           these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest
           of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.

16:006:015 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the
           month Elul, in fifty and two days.

16:006:016 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof,
           and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they
           were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that
           this work was wrought of our God.

16:006:017 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters
           unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

16:006:018 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was
           the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son
           Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of
           Berechiah.

16:006:019 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my
           words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

16:007:001 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up
           the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites
           were appointed,

16:007:002 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
           palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and
           feared God above many.

16:007:003 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
           until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut
           the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the
           inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every
           one to be over against his house.

16:007:004 Now the city was large and great: but the people were few
           therein, and the houses were not builded.

16:007:005 And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,
           and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by
           genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them
           which came up at the first, and found written therein,

16:007:006 These are the children of the province, that went up out of
           the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom
           Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came
           again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;

16:007:007 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,
           Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.
           The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was
           this;

16:007:008 The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and
           two.

           eight.

16:007:028 The men of Bethazmaveth, forty and two.

16:007:029 The men of Kirjathjearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven
           hundred forty and three.

16:007:030 The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one.

16:007:031 The men of Michmas, an hundred and twenty and two.

16:007:033 The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.

           Hatita, the children of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight.

16:007:046 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha,
           the children of Tabbaoth,

16:007:047 The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of
           Padon,

16:007:048 The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children
           of Shalmai,

16:007:049 The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of
           Gahar,

16:007:050 The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of
           Nekoda,

16:007:051 The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of
           Phaseah,

           Nephishesim,

16:007:053 The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children
           of Harhur,

16:007:054 The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children
           of Harsha,

16:007:055 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children
           of Tamah,

16:007:056 The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

16:007:057 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
           children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,

16:007:058 The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of
           Giddel,

16:007:059 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the
           children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.

16:007:060 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
           were three hundred ninety and two.

16:007:061 And these were they which went up also from Telmelah,
           Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew
           their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of
           Israel.

16:007:062 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
           of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.

16:007:063 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of
           Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the
           daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called
           after their name.

16:007:064 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
           genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as
           polluted, put from the priesthood.

16:007:065 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
           the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
           and Thummim.

16:007:066 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
           three hundred and threescore,

16:007:067 Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there
           were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they
           had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.

16:007:068 Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two
           hundred forty and five:

16:007:069 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven
           hundred and twenty asses.

16:007:070 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
           Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty
           basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.

16:007:071 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of
           the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and
           two hundred pound of silver.

16:007:072 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
           drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and
           threescore and seven priests' garments.

16:007:073 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the
           singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all
           Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month
           came, the children of Israel were in their cities.

16:008:001 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man
           into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake
           unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses,
           which the LORD had commanded to Israel.

16:008:002 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation
           both of men and women, and all that could hear with
           understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.

16:008:003 And he read therein before the street that was before the
           water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and
           the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of
           all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.

16:008:004 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they
           had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and
           Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on
           his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael,
           and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and
           Meshullam.

16:008:005 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for
           he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the
           people stood up:

16:008:006 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people
           answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they
           bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to
           the ground.

16:008:007 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub,
           Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad,
           Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to
           understand the law: and the people stood in their place.

16:008:008 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and
           gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.

16:008:009 And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
           scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all
           the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn
           not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the
           words of the law.

16:008:010 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink
           the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is
           prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye
           sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.

16:008:011 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your
           peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.

16:008:012 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to
           send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had
           understood the words that were declared unto them.

16:008:013 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
           fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto
           Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.

16:008:014 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded
           by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths
           in the feast of the seventh month:

16:008:015 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities,
           and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch
           olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and
           palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as
           it is written.

16:008:016 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made
           themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and
           in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in
           the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of
           Ephraim.

16:008:017 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of
           the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since
           the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the
           children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.

16:008:018 Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read
           in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven
           days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according
           unto the manner.

16:009:001 Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of
           Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and
           earth upon them.

16:009:002 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all
           strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the
           iniquities of their fathers.

16:009:003 And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the
           law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and
           another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD
           their God.

16:009:004 Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and
           Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani,
           and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.

16:009:005 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,
           Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up
           and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be
           thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and
           praise.

16:009:006 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the
           heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all
           things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein,
           and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven
           worshippeth thee.

16:009:007 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and
           broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him
           the name of Abraham;

16:009:008 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a
           covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the
           Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites,
           and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast
           performed thy words; for thou art righteous:

16:009:009 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and
           heardest their cry by the Red sea;

16:009:010 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his
           servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest
           that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a
           name, as it is this day.

16:009:011 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went
           through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their
           persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the
           mighty waters.

16:009:012 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and
           in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the
           way wherein they should go.

16:009:013 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them
           from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws,
           good statutes and commandments:

16:009:014 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst
           them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy
           servant:

16:009:015 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and
           broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their
           thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess
           the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.

16:009:016 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their
           necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,

16:009:017 And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that
           thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their
           rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but
           thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to
           anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.

16:009:018 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is
           thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought
           great provocations;

16:009:019 Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the
           wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by
           day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by
           night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.

16:009:020 Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and
           withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them
           water for their thirst.

16:009:021 Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so
           that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and
           their feet swelled not.

16:009:022 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst
           divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon,
           and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king
           of Bashan.

16:009:023 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven,
           and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst
           promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess
           it.

16:009:024 So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou
           subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the
           Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their
           kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with
           them as they would.

16:009:025 And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed
           houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and
           oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and
           were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy
           great goodness.

16:009:026 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,
           and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets
           which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they
           wrought great provocations.

16:009:027 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their
           enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble,
           when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and
           according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours,
           who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.

16:009:028 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:
           therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so
           that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned,
           and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many
           times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;

16:009:029 And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them
           again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not
           unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments,
           (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the
           shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.

16:009:030 Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst
           against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not
           give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the
           people of the lands.

16:009:031 Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not
           utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a
           gracious and merciful God.

16:009:032 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the
           terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the
           trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on
           our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our
           prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the
           time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.

16:009:033 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou
           hast done right, but we have done wickedly:

16:009:034 Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our
           fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and
           thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.

16:009:035 For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy
           great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat
           land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from
           their wicked works.

16:009:036 Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou
           gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good
           thereof, behold, we are servants in it:

16:009:037 And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast
           set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over
           our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are
           in great distress.

16:009:038 And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;
           and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

16:010:001 Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son
           of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,

16:010:002 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

16:010:003 Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,

16:010:004 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

16:010:007 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

16:010:008 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.

16:010:009 And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the
           sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;

16:010:010 And their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah,
           Hanan,

16:010:011 Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,

16:010:012 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

16:010:013 Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.

16:010:014 The chief of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu,
           Bani,

16:010:015 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

16:010:016 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

16:010:017 Ater, Hizkijah, Azzur,

16:010:018 Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,

16:010:019 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,

16:010:020 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,

16:010:021 Meshezabeel, Zadok, Jaddua,

16:010:022 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,

16:010:023 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hashub,

16:010:024 Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,

16:010:025 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,

16:010:026 And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,

16:010:027 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

16:010:028 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the
           porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had
           separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law
           of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every
           one having knowledge, and having understanding;

16:010:029 They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a
           curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given
           by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the
           commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his
           statutes;

16:010:030 And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of
           the land, not take their daughters for our sons:

16:010:031 And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on
           the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on
           the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the
           seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.

16:010:032 Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly
           with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house
           of our God;

16:010:033 For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and
           for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new
           moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for
           the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all
           the work of the house of our God.

16:010:034 And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the
           people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of
           our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed
           year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as
           it is written in the law:

16:010:035 And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the
           firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the
           house of the LORD:

16:010:036 Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is
           written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our
           flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests
           that minister in the house of our God:

16:010:037 And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
           offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and
           of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our
           God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the
           same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our
           tillage.

16:010:038 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites,
           when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up
           the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the
           chambers, into the treasure house.

16:010:039 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall
           bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil,
           unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and
           the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers:
           and we will not forsake the house of our God.

16:011:001 And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of
           the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in
           Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other
           cities.

16:011:002 And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered
           themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.

16:011:003 Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in
           Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his
           possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and
           the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's
           servants.

16:011:004 And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and
           of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah
           the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah,
           the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children
           of Perez;

           of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of
           Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.

16:011:006 All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four
           hundred threescore and eight valiant men.

16:011:007 And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of
           Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of
           Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of
           Jesaiah.

16:011:008 And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

16:011:009 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the
           son of Senuah was second over the city.

16:011:010 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.

16:011:011 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of
           Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler
           of the house of God.

16:011:012 And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight
           hundred twenty and two: and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son
           of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of
           Pashur, the son of Malchiah.

16:011:013 And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and
           two: and Amashai the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the
           son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,

16:011:014 And their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty
           and eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of one of
           the great men.

16:011:015 Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of
           Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;

16:011:016 And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had
           the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.

16:011:017 And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of
           Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer:
           and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son
           of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.

16:011:018 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore
           and four.

16:011:019 Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that
           kept the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.

16:011:020 And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites,
           were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.

16:011:021 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over
           the Nethinims.

16:011:022 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son
           of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son
           of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the
           business of the house of God.

16:011:023 For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a
           certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.

16:011:024 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah
           the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters
           concerning the people.

16:011:025 And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children
           of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof,
           and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel,
           and in the villages thereof,

16:011:026 And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Bethphelet,

16:011:027 And at Hazarshual, and at Beersheba, and in the villages
           thereof,

16:011:028 And at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,

16:011:029 And at Enrimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth,

16:011:030 Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish, and the
           fields thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And
           they dwelt from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom.

16:011:031 The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and
           Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages.

16:011:032 And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

16:011:033 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

16:011:034 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

16:011:035 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.

16:011:036 And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.

16:012:001 Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with
           Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah,
           Jeremiah, Ezra,

16:012:002 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

16:012:003 Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

16:012:004 Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,

16:012:005 Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

16:012:006 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

16:012:007 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the
           priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.

16:012:008 Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah,
           Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and
           his brethren.

16:012:009 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against
           them in the watches.

16:012:010 And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and
           Eliashib begat Joiada,

16:012:011 And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.

16:012:012 And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the
           fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

16:012:013 Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

16:012:014 Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

16:012:015 Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;

16:012:016 Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

16:012:017 Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai:

16:012:018 Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

16:012:019 And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

16:012:020 Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

16:012:021 Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

16:012:022 The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
           Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests,
           to the reign of Darius the Persian.

16:012:023 The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in
           the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the
           son of Eliashib.

16:012:024 And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
           the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to
           praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of
           David the man of God, ward over against ward.

16:012:025 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
           were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.

16:012:026 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son
           of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of
           Ezra the priest, the scribe.

16:012:027 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
           Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem,
           to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings,
           and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.

16:012:028 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both
           out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the
           villages of Netophathi;

16:012:029 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba
           and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round
           about Jerusalem.

16:012:030 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and
           purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.

16:012:031 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and
           appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks,
           whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the
           dung gate:

16:012:032 And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of
           Judah,

16:012:033 And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

16:012:034 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

16:012:035 And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely,
           Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of
           Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of
           Asaph:

16:012:036 And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai,
           Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical
           instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe
           before them.

16:012:037 And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they
           went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of
           the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate
           eastward.

16:012:038 And the other company of them that gave thanks went over
           against them, and I after them, and the half of the people
           upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto
           the broad wall;

16:012:039 And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate,
           and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the
           tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still
           in the prison gate.

16:012:040 So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the
           house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:

16:012:041 And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah,
           Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;

16:012:042 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and
           Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers
           sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.

16:012:043 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for
           God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and
           the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard
           even afar off.

16:012:044 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
           treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the
           tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities
           the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah
           rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.

16:012:045 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their
           God, and the ward of the purification, according to the
           commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.

16:012:046 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of
           the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

16:012:047 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
           Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters,
           every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto
           the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children
           of Aaron.

16:013:001 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of
           the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite
           and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God
           for ever;

16:013:002 Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and
           with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should
           curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.

16:013:003 Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
           separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.

16:013:004 And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of
           the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:

16:013:005 And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime
           they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the
           vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the
           oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the
           singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.

16:013:006 But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two
           and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto
           the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:

16:013:007 And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that
           Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the
           courts of the house of God.

16:013:008 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the
           household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.

16:013:009 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
           brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat
           offering and the frankincense.

16:013:010 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
           given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the
           work, were fled every one to his field.

16:013:011 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house
           of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in
           their place.

16:013:012 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
           and the oil unto the treasuries.

16:013:013 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the
           priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and
           next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of
           Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office
           was to distribute unto their brethren.

16:013:014 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my
           good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for
           the offices thereof.

16:013:015 In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
           sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also
           wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they
           brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
           against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.

16:013:016 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and
           all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children
           of Judah, and in Jerusalem.

16:013:017 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
           What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath
           day?

16:013:018 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
           evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon
           Israel by profaning the sabbath.

16:013:019 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
           be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should
           be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after
           the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that
           there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.

16:013:020 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged
           without Jerusalem once or twice.

16:013:021 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge
           ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.
           From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.

16:013:022 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse
           themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to
           sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning
           this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy
           mercy.

16:013:023 In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of
           Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:

16:013:024 And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and
           could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the
           language of each people.

16:013:025 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain
           of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by
           God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons,
           nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.

16:013:026 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among
           many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of
           his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless
           even him did outlandish women cause to sin.

16:013:027 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
           transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?

16:013:028 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high
           priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I
           chased him from me.

16:013:029 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
           priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the
           Levites.

16:013:030 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the
           wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his
           business;

16:013:031 And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the
           firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

Book 17        Esther

17:001:001 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is
           Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over
           an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)

17:001:002 That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne
           of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,

17:001:003 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his
           princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the
           nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:

17:001:004 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the
           honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and
           fourscore days.

17:001:005 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto
           all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both
           unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden
           of the king's palace;

17:001:006 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with
           cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of
           marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of
           red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.

17:001:007 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels
           being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance,
           according to the state of the king.

17:001:008 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel:
           for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his
           house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.

17:001:009 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
           house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.

17:001:010 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
           wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and
           Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that
           served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,

17:001:011 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown
           royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she
           was fair to look on.

17:001:012 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment
           by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and
           his anger burned in him.

17:001:013 Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for
           so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and
           judgment:

17:001:014 And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha,
           Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of
           Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the
           first in the kingdom;)

17:001:015 What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law,
           because she hath not performed the commandment of the king
           Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?

17:001:016 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti
           the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to
           all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the
           provinces of the king Ahasuerus.

17:001:017 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women,
           so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when
           it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the
           queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.

17:001:018 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day
           unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of
           the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.

17:001:019 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from
           him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and
           the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more
           before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate
           unto another that is better than she.

17:001:020 And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be
           published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all
           the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great
           and small.

17:001:021 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king
           did according to the word of Memucan:

17:001:022 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every
           province according to the writing thereof, and to every people
           after their language, that every man should bear rule in his
           own house, and that it should be published according to the
           language of every people.

17:002:001 After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was
           appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and
           what was decreed against her.

17:002:002 Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let
           there be fair young virgins sought for the king:

17:002:003 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his
           kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young
           virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women,
           unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the
           women; and let their things for purification be given them:

17:002:004 And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of
           Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.

17:002:005 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name
           was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of
           Kish, a Benjamite;

17:002:006 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
           which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom
           Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.

17:002:007 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's
           daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid
           was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and
           mother were dead, took for his own daughter.

17:002:008 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree
           was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto
           Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was
           brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai,
           keeper of the women.

17:002:009 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him;
           and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with
           such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were
           meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he
           preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house
           of the women.

17:002:010 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
           had charged her that she should not shew it.

17:002:011 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's
           house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

17:002:012 Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king
           Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to
           the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their
           purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of
           myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things
           for the purifying of the women;)

17:002:013 Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she
           desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the
           women unto the king's house.

17:002:014 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into
           the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz,
           the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in
           unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and
           that she were called by name.

17:002:015 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle
           of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to
           go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the
           king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And
           Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked
           upon her.

17:002:016 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal
           in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh
           year of his reign.

17:002:017 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she
           obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the
           virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and
           made her queen instead of Vashti.

17:002:018 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
           servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the
           provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.

17:002:019 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time,
           then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

17:002:020 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as
           Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of
           Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.

17:002:021 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of
           the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which
           kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king
           Ahasuerus.

17:002:022 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther
           the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's
           name.

17:002:023 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
           therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written
           in the book of the chronicles before the king.

17:003:001 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
           Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat
           above all the princes that were with him.

17:003:002 And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate,
           bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded
           concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.

17:003:003 Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said
           unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?

17:003:004 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he
           hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether
           Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he
           was a Jew.

17:003:005 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him
           reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.

17:003:006 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they
           had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought
           to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom
           of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.

17:003:007 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth
           year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot,
           before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the
           twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.

17:003:008 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
           scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the
           provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all
           people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not
           for the king's profit to suffer them.

17:003:009 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
           destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to
           the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to
           bring it into the king's treasuries.

17:003:010 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto
           Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.

17:003:011 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the
           people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

17:003:012 Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of
           the first month, and there was written according to all that
           Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the
           governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of
           every people of every province according to the writing
           thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name
           of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's
           ring.

17:003:013 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's
           provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all
           Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one
           day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which
           is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.

17:003:014 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
           province was published unto all people, that they should be
           ready against that day.

17:003:015 The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment,
           and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king
           and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was
           perplexed.

17:004:001 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
           clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into
           the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;

17:004:002 And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter
           into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.

17:004:003 And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment
           and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews,
           and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in
           sackcloth and ashes.

17:004:004 So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her.
           Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment
           to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him:
           but he received it not.

17:004:005 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains,
           whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a
           commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.

17:004:006 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
           which was before the king's gate.

17:004:007 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and
           of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the
           king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

17:004:008 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that
           was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther,
           and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should
           go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to
           make request before him for her people.

17:004:009 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.

17:004:010 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
           Mordecai;

17:004:011 All the king's servants, and the people of the king's
           provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women,
           shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not
           called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except
           such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that
           he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the
           king these thirty days.

17:004:012 And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.

17:004:013 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with
           thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than
           all the Jews.

17:004:014 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then
           shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from
           another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be
           destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the
           kingdom for such a time as this?

17:004:015 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,

17:004:016 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan,
           and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days,
           night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so
           will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law:
           and if I perish, I perish.

17:004:017 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
           had commanded him.

17:005:001 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her
           royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's
           house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon
           his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of
           the house.

17:005:002 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in
           the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king
           held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So
           Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.

17:005:003 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
           what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half
           of the kingdom.

17:005:004 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the
           king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
           prepared for him.

17:005:005 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do
           as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet
           that Esther had prepared.

17:005:006 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is
           thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy
           request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be
           performed.

17:005:007 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;

17:005:008 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it
           please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my
           request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I
           shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king
           hath said.

17:005:009 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:
           but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood
           not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against
           Mordecai.

17:005:010 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home,
           he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

17:005:011 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the
           multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king
           had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the
           princes and servants of the king.

17:005:012 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come
           in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but
           myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the
           king.

17:005:013 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
           the Jew sitting at the king's gate.

17:005:014 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
           gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou
           unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go
           thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing
           pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

17:006:001 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to
           bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were
           read before the king.

17:006:002 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
           and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the
           door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

17:006:003 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
           Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that
           ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.

17:006:004 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come
           into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the
           king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for
           him.

17:006:005 And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth
           in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.

17:006:006 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be
           done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now
           Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to
           do honour more than to myself?

17:006:007 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king
           delighteth to honour,

17:006:008 Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear,
           and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal
           which is set upon his head:

17:006:009 And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one
           of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man
           withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on
           horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before
           him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth
           to honour.

17:006:010 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel
           and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
           the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of
           all that thou hast spoken.

17:006:011 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed
           Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of
           the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done
           unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.

17:006:012 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted
           to his house mourning, and having his head covered.

17:006:013 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
           that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his
           wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before
           whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against
           him, but shalt surely fall before him.

17:006:014 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's
           chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that
           Esther had prepared.

17:007:001 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

17:007:002 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
           banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it
           shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall
           be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.

17:007:003 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found
           favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my
           life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:

17:007:004 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be
           slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and
           bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not
           countervail the king's damage.

17:007:005 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the
           queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his
           heart to do so?

17:007:006 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
           Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

17:007:007 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath
           went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make
           request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that
           there was evil determined against him by the king.

17:007:008 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
           of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed
           whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the
           queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of
           king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.

17:007:009 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
           Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had
           made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in
           the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.

17:007:010 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
           Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.

17:008:001 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the
           Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before
           the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.

17:008:002 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman,
           and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the
           house of Haman.

17:008:003 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at
           his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief
           of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised
           against the Jews.

17:008:004 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So
           Esther arose, and stood before the king,

17:008:005 And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his
           sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be
           pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters
           devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he
           wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's
           provinces:

17:008:006 For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my
           people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my
           kindred?

17:008:007 Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to
           Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of
           Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he
           laid his hand upon the Jews.

17:008:008 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's
           name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which
           is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's
           ring, may no man reverse.

17:008:009 Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third
           month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth
           day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai
           commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the
           deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto
           Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every
           province according to the writing thereof, and unto every
           people after their language, and to the Jews according to
           their writing, and according to their language.

17:008:010 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with
           the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and
           riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:

17:008:011 Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to
           gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to
           destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the
           people and province that would assault them, both little ones
           and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,

17:008:012 Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely,
           upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the
           month Adar.

17:008:013 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
           province was published unto all people, and that the Jews
           should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their
           enemies.

17:008:014 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being
           hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the
           decree was given at Shushan the palace.

17:008:015 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
           apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and
           with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of
           Shushan rejoiced and was glad.

17:008:016 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.

17:008:017 And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the
           king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and
           gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of
           the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.

17:009:001 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the
           thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and
           his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that
           the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though
           it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over
           them that hated them;)

17:009:002 The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities
           throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay
           hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand
           them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.

17:009:003 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and
           the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews;
           because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.

17:009:004 For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went
           out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed
           greater and greater.

17:009:005 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
           sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would
           unto those that hated them.

17:009:006 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five
           hundred men.

17:009:007 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

17:009:008 And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,

17:009:009 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,

17:009:010 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the
           Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.

17:009:011 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
           palace was brought before the king.

17:009:012 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain
           and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the
           ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the
           king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be
           granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be
           done.

17:009:013 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to
           the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according
           unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged
           upon the gallows.

17:009:014 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was
           given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

17:009:015 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together
           on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three
           hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their
           hand.

17:009:016 But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered
           themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest
           from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five
           thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,

17:009:017 On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth
           day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and
           gladness.

17:009:018 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
           thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on
           the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day
           of feasting and gladness.

17:009:019 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
           towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of
           gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions
           one to another.

17:009:020 And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the
           Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
           both nigh and far,

17:009:021 To stablish this among them, that they should keep the
           fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the
           same, yearly,

17:009:022 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and
           the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and
           from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days
           of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another,
           and gifts to the poor.

17:009:023 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as
           Mordecai had written unto them;

17:009:024 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of
           all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them,
           and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to
           destroy them;

17:009:025 But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters
           that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews,
           should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons
           should be hanged on the gallows.

17:009:026 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
           Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which
           they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto
           them,

17:009:027 The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed,
           and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it
           should not fail, that they would keep these two days according
           to their writing, and according to their appointed time every
           year;

17:009:028 And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout
           every generation, every family, every province, and every
           city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among
           the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.

17:009:029 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
           the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second
           letter of Purim.

17:009:030 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred
           twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with
           words of peace and truth,

17:009:031 To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed,
           according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had
           enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for
           their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.

17:009:032 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and
           it was written in the book.

17:010:001 And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon
           the isles of the sea.

17:010:002 And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the
           declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king
           advanced him, are they not written in the book of the
           chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?

17:010:003 For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great
           among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren,
           seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all
           his seed.

Book 18        Job

18:001:001 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and
           that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and
           eschewed evil.

18:001:002 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

18:001:003 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
           thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five
           hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this
           man was the greatest of all the men of the east.

18:001:004 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his
           day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
           drink with them.

18:001:005 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone
           about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in
           the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
           number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have
           sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job
           continually.

18:001:006 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
           themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.

18:001:007 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
           answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the
           earth, and from walking up and down in it.

18:001:008 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
           Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
           an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?

18:001:009 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for
           nought?

18:001:010 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,
           and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed
           the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
           land.

18:001:011 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and
           he will curse thee to thy face.

18:001:012 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in
           thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So
           Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.

18:001:013 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were
           eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:

18:001:014 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
           plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:

18:001:015 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they
           have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
           am escaped alone to tell thee.

18:001:016 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
           The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the
           sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
           escaped alone to tell thee.

18:001:017 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
           The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,
           and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with
           the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell
           thee.

18:001:018 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
           Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in
           their eldest brother's house:

18:001:019 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and
           smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the
           young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to
           tell thee.

18:001:020 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
           fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,

18:001:021 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
           shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken
           away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

18:001:022 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

18:002:001 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
           themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to
           present himself before the LORD.

18:002:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And
           Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in
           the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

18:002:003 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
           Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
           an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and
           still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me
           against him, to destroy him without cause.

18:002:004 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
           that a man hath will he give for his life.

18:002:005 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
