09:012:015 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel
           against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of
           the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.

09:012:016 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
           will do before your eyes.

09:012:017 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
           he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see
           that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight
           of the LORD, in asking you a king.

09:012:018 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
           rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and
           Samuel.

09:012:019 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants
           unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto
           all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.

09:012:020 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all
           this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD,
           but serve the LORD with all your heart;

09:012:021 And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain
           things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.

09:012:022 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's
           sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.

09:012:023 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
           LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good
           and the right way:

09:012:024 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your
           heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.

09:012:025 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both
           ye and your king.

09:013:001 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
           Israel,

09:013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two
           thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a
           thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the
           rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.

09:013:003 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
           Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the
           trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

09:013:004 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of
           the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination
           with the Philistines. And the people were called together
           after Saul to Gilgal.

09:013:005 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
           Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
           and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude:
           and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from
           Bethaven.

09:013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for
           the people were distressed,) then the people did hide
           themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in
           high places, and in pits.

09:013:007 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad
           and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the
           people followed him trembling.

09:013:008 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that
           Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the
           people were scattered from him.

09:013:009 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
           offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

09:013:010 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
           offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul
           went out to meet him, that he might salute him.

09:013:011 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
           saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou
           camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines
           gathered themselves together at Michmash;

09:013:012 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me
           to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I
           forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

09:013:013 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast
           not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he
           commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy
           kingdom upon Israel for ever.

09:013:014 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought
           him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him
           to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that
           which the LORD commanded thee.

09:013:015 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
           Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with
           him, about six hundred men.

09:013:016 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were
           present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the
           Philistines encamped in Michmash.

09:013:017 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
           three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth
           to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:

09:013:018 And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another
           company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the
           valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

09:013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of
           Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
           swords or spears:

09:013:020 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to
           sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and
           his mattock.

09:013:021 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters,
           and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

09:013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was
           neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people
           that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with
           Jonathan his son was there found.

09:013:023 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
           Michmash.

09:014:001 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
           said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us
           go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other
           side. But he told not his father.

09:014:002 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
           pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were
           with him were about six hundred men;

09:014:003 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of
           Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing
           an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.

09:014:004 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
           unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the
           one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of
           the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

09:014:005 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
           Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

09:014:006 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
           and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised:
           it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no
           restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.

09:014:007 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
           heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy
           heart.

09:014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men,
           and we will discover ourselves unto them.

09:014:009 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
           will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

09:014:010 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
           the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be
           a sign unto us.

09:014:011 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of
           the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews
           come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

09:014:012 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
           armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a
           thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after
           me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

09:014:013 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
           his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and
           his armourbearer slew after him.

09:014:014 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
           made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of
           land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.

09:014:015 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among
           all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also
           trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great
           trembling.

09:014:016 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
           behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating
           down one another.

09:014:017 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
           and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered,
           behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.

09:014:018 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
           ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

09:014:019 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that
           the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and
           increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

09:014:020 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
           themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every
           man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great
           discomfiture.

09:014:021 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before
           that time, which went up with them into the camp from the
           country round about, even they also turned to be with the
           Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

09:014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
           mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even
           they also followed hard after them in the battle.

09:014:023 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
           unto Bethaven.

09:014:024 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
           adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any
           food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So
           none of the people tasted any food.

09:014:025 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
           upon the ground.

09:014:026 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
           dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people
           feared the oath.

09:014:027 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
           the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was
           in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand
           to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.

09:014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
           charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man
           that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.

09:014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
           pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I
           tasted a little of this honey.

09:014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
           the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not
           been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

09:014:031 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to
           Aijalon: and the people were very faint.

09:014:032 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
           and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did
           eat them with the blood.

09:014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against
           the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye
           have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

09:014:034 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
           unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his
           sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the
           LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought
           every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.

09:014:035 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
           altar that he built unto the LORD.

09:014:036 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
           and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a
           man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto
           thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

09:014:037 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
           Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?
           But he answered him not that day.

09:014:038 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the
           people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

09:014:039 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
           Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man
           among all the people that answered him.

09:014:040 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
           Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said
           unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

09:014:041 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a
           perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people
           escaped.

09:014:042 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
           Jonathan was taken.

09:014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
           Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey
           with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must
           die.

09:014:044 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
           surely die, Jonathan.

09:014:045 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
           wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the
           LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the
           ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people
           rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

09:014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
           Philistines went to their own place.

09:014:047 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all
           his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the
           children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of
           Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he
           turned himself, he vexed them.

09:014:048 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and
           delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

09:014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
           and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the
           firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

09:014:050 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of
           Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner,
           the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.

09:014:051 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
           was the son of Abiel.

09:014:052 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
           Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he
           took him unto him.

09:015:001 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to
           be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken
           thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.

09:015:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did
           to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came
           up from Egypt.

09:015:003 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
           have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant
           and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

09:015:004 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
           Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of
           Judah.

09:015:005 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the
           valley.

09:015:006 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
           among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye
           shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came
           up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the
           Amalekites.

09:015:007 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest
           to Shur, that is over against Egypt.

09:015:008 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
           destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

09:015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the
           sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs,
           and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but
           every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed
           utterly.

09:015:010 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,

09:015:011 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is
           turned back from following me, and hath not performed my
           commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the
           LORD all night.

09:015:012 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
           told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set
           him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone
           down to Gilgal.

09:015:013 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be
           thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the
           LORD.

09:015:014 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep
           in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

09:015:015 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for
           the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to
           sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly
           destroyed.

09:015:016 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what
           the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say
           on.

09:015:017 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight,
           wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the
           LORD anointed thee king over Israel?

09:015:018 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly
           destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them
           until they be consumed.

09:015:019 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
           didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the
           LORD?

09:015:020 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
           LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have
           brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed
           the Amalekites.

09:015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
           the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to
           sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

09:015:022 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
           offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?
           Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than
           the fat of rams.

09:015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
           as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word
           of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

09:015:024 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
           transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words:
           because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

09:015:025 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
           me, that I may worship the LORD.

09:015:026 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for
           thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath
           rejected thee from being king over Israel.

09:015:027 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
           skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

09:015:028 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
           Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of
           thine, that is better than thou.

09:015:029 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for
           he is not a man, that he should repent.

09:015:030 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
           before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn
           again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

09:015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the
           LORD.

09:015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
           Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said,
           Surely the bitterness of death is past.

09:015:033 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
           shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed
           Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

09:015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
           Gibeah of Saul.

09:015:035 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his
           death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD
           repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

09:016:001 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for
           Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?
           fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse
           the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his
           sons.

09:016:002 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill
           me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am
           come to sacrifice to the LORD.

09:016:003 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what
           thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name
           unto thee.

09:016:004 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to
           Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming,
           and said, Comest thou peaceably?

09:016:005 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:
           sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he
           sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the
           sacrifice.

09:016:006 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
           Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.

09:016:007 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or
           on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for
           the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the
           outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.

09:016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
           And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

09:016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath
           the LORD chosen this.

09:016:010 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
           Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

09:016:011 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
           said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he
           keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch
           him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

09:016:012 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal
           of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the
           LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

09:016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
           midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon
           David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to
           Ramah.

09:016:014 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
           spirit from the LORD troubled him.

09:016:015 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
           from God troubleth thee.

09:016:016 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee,
           to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it
           shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon
           thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be
           well.

09:016:017 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
           play well, and bring him to me.

09:016:018 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have
           seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in
           playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and
           prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with
           him.

09:016:019 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
           David thy son, which is with the sheep.

09:016:020 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
           and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

09:016:021 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
           greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

09:016:022 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
           before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

09:016:023 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
           Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so
           Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed
           from him.

09:017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
           and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to
           Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

09:017:002 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
           pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array
           against the Philistines.

09:017:003 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
           Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a
           valley between them.

09:017:004 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the
           Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six
           cubits and a span.

09:017:005 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
           with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five
           thousand shekels of brass.

09:017:006 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of
           brass between his shoulders.

09:017:007 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his
           spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one
           bearing a shield went before him.

09:017:008 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said
           unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am
           not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man
           for you, and let him come down to me.

09:017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we
           be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him,
           then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.

09:017:010 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
           give me a man, that we may fight together.

09:017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
           they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

09:017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
           whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went
           among men for an old man in the days of Saul.

09:017:013 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to
           the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the
           battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab,
           and the third Shammah.

09:017:014 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed
           Saul.

09:017:015 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's
           sheep at Bethlehem.

09:017:016 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and
           presented himself forty days.

09:017:017 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren
           an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run
           to the camp of thy brethren;

09:017:018 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their
           thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their
           pledge.

09:017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
           valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

09:017:020 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep
           with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;
           and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the
           fight, and shouted for the battle.

09:017:021 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,
           army against army.

09:017:022 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
           carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his
           brethren.

09:017:023 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the
           champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the
           armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same
           words: and David heard them.

09:017:024 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
           him, and were sore afraid.

09:017:025 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
           up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that
           the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great
           riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's
           house free in Israel.

09:017:026 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What
           shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and
           taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this
           uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of
           the living God?

09:017:027 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So
           shall it be done to the man that killeth him.

09:017:028 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
           and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why
           camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those
           few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the
           naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou
           mightest see the battle.

09:017:029 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

09:017:030 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the
           same manner: and the people answered him again after the
           former manner.

09:017:031 And when the words were heard which David spake, they
           rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.

09:017:032 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of
           him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

09:017:033 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
           Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he
           a man of war from his youth.

09:017:034 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
           and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the
           flock:

09:017:035 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out
           of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by
           his beard, and smote him, and slew him.

09:017:036 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
           uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he
           hath defied the armies of the living God.

09:017:037 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
           of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
           me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto
           David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.

09:017:038 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
           brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

09:017:039 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
           go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I
           cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David
           put them off him.

09:017:040 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
           stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag
           which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand:
           and he drew near to the Philistine.

09:017:041 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the
           man that bare the shield went before him.

09:017:042 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
           disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a
           fair countenance.

09:017:043 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou
           comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by
           his gods.

09:017:044 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
           thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the
           field.

09:017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
           sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee
           in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of
           Israel, whom thou hast defied.

09:017:046 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
           smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the
           carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the
           fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that
           all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

09:017:047 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
           sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will
           give you into our hands.

09:017:048 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
           drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward
           the army to meet the Philistine.

09:017:049 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
           and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
           the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to
           the earth.

09:017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
           stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was
           no sword in the hand of David.

09:017:051 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
           his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew
           him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines
           saw their champion was dead, they fled.

09:017:052 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
           pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to
           the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell
           down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

09:017:053 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
           Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

09:017:054 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
           Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

09:017:055 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he
           said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is
           this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I
           cannot tell.

09:017:056 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

09:017:057 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
           Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of
           the Philistine in his hand.

09:017:058 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
           David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the
           Bethlehemite.

09:018:001 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
           Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of
           David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

09:018:002 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
           to his father's house.

09:018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
           as his own soul.

09:018:004 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,
           and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and
           to his bow, and to his girdle.

09:018:005 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
           himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he
           was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the
           sight of Saul's servants.

09:018:006 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
           the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of
           all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,
           with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.

09:018:007 And the women answered one another as they played, and said,
           Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

09:018:008 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
           said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me
           they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more
           but the kingdom?

09:018:009 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

09:018:010 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
           God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the
           house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and
           there was a javelin in Saul's hand.

09:018:011 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David
           even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his
           presence twice.

09:018:012 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him,
           and was departed from Saul.

09:018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
           over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the
           people.

09:018:014 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
           was with him.

09:018:015 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely,
           he was afraid of him.

09:018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
           came in before them.

09:018:017 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her
           will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and
           fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be
           upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.

09:018:018 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
           father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the
           king?

09:018:019 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter
           should have been given to David, that she was given unto
           Adriel the Meholathite to wife.

09:018:020 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul,
           and the thing pleased him.

09:018:021 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
           him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
           Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in
           law in the one of the twain.

09:018:022 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
           secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and
           all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in
           law.

09:018:023 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.
           And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's
           son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

09:018:024 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner
           spake David.

09:018:025 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth
           not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to
           be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make
           David fall by the hand of the Philistines.

09:018:026 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
           well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not
           expired.

09:018:027 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of
           the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their
           foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that
           he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal
           his daughter to wife.

09:018:028 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
           Michal Saul's daughter loved him.

09:018:029 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
           David's enemy continually.

09:018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to
           pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more
           wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was
           much set by.

09:019:001 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
           that they should kill David.

09:019:002 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
           told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now
           therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the
           morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:

09:019:003 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
           where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and
           what I see, that I will tell thee.

09:019:004 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and
           said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant,
           against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and
           because his works have been to thee-ward very good:

09:019:005 For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
           and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
           sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin
           against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

09:019:006 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,
           As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

09:019:007 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
           things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his
           presence, as in times past.

09:019:008 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with
           the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and
           they fled from him.

09:019:009 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in
           his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with
           his hand.

09:019:010 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
           javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he
           smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped
           that night.

09:019:011 Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him,
           and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told
           him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow
           thou shalt be slain.

09:019:012 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
           fled, and escaped.

09:019:013 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
           pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a
           cloth.

09:019:014 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
           sick.

09:019:015 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
           him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

09:019:016 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an
           image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his
           bolster.

09:019:017 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
           sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered
           Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

09:019:018 So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and
           told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
           and dwelt in Naioth.

09:019:019 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
           Ramah.

09:019:020 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
           company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as
           appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers
           of Saul, and they also prophesied.

09:019:021 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
           prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third
           time, and they prophesied also.

09:019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is
           in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David?
           And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

09:019:023 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
           was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he
           came to Naioth in Ramah.

09:019:024 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
           Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all
           that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the
           prophets?

09:020:001 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
           Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is
           my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

09:020:002 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold,
           my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he
           will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from
           me? it is not so.

09:020:003 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly
           knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith,
           Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as
           the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step
           between me and death.

09:020:004 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
           will even do it for thee.

09:020:005 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new
           moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but
           let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third
           day at even.

09:020:006 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
           leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there
           is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

09:020:007 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but
           if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by
           him.

09:020:008 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou
           hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with
           thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me
           thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

09:020:009 And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew
           certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon
           thee, then would not I tell it thee?

09:020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy
           father answer thee roughly?

09:020:011 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the
           field. And they went out both of them into the field.

09:020:012 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I
           have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third
           day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then
           send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

09:020:013 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my
           father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send
           thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with
           thee, as he hath been with my father.

09:020:014 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness
           of the LORD, that I die not:

09:020:015 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for
           ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
           every one from the face of the earth.

09:020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying,
           Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

09:020:017 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
           him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

09:020:018 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and
           thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

09:020:019 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
           quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
           when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone
           Ezel.

09:020:020 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
           shot at a mark.

09:020:021 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the
           arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows
           are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there
           is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.

09:020:022 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
           beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

09:020:023 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
           behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

09:020:024 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
           come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

09:020:025 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
           seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's
           side, and David's place was empty.

09:020:026 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he
           thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely
           he is not clean.

09:020:027 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
           the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto
           Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to
           meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

09:020:028 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me
           to go to Bethlehem:

09:020:029 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
           sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to
           be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let
           me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he
           cometh not unto the king's table.

09:020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
           unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I
           know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own
           confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?

09:020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou
           shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send
           and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.

09:020:032 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
           Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?

09:020:033 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan
           knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

09:020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat
           no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
           David, because his father had done him shame.

09:020:035 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
           into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little
           lad with him.

09:020:036 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
           shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

09:020:037 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
           Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is
           not the arrow beyond thee?

09:020:038 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.
           And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
           master.

09:020:039 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
           the matter.

09:020:040 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto
           him, Go, carry them to the city.

09:020:041 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
           toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and
           bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and
           wept one with another, until David exceeded.

09:020:042 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
           sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be
           between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for
           ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the
           city.

09:021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech
           was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art
           thou alone, and no man with thee?

09:021:002 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath
           commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man
           know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and
           what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants
           to such and such a place.

09:021:003 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
           bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

09:021:004 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common
           bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the
           young men have kept themselves at least from women.

09:021:005 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
           women have been kept from us about these three days, since I
           came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the
           bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified
           this day in the vessel.

09:021:006 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
           there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD,
           to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

09:021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
           detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite,
           the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

09:021:008 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under
           thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword
           nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required
           haste.

09:021:009 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
           thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped
           in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it:
           for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is
           none like that; give it me.

09:021:010 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went
           to Achish the king of Gath.

09:021:011 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David
           the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him
           in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
           his ten thousands?

09:021:012 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore
           afraid of Achish the king of Gath.

09:021:013 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
           mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
           and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.

09:021:014 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
           wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

09:021:015 Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to
           play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into
           my house?

09:022:001 David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave
           Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house
           heard it, they went down thither to him.

09:022:002 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
           debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves
           unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were
           with him about four hundred men.

09:022:003 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
           king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come
           forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.

09:022:004 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt
           with him all the while that David was in the hold.

09:022:005 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
           depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David
           departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.

09:022:006 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that
           were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in
           Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were
           standing about him;)

09:022:007 Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear
           now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of
           you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of
           thousands, and captains of hundreds;

09:022:008 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
           that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
           Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or
           sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against
           me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

09:022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the
           servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to
           Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

09:022:010 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals,
           and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

09:022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
           Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in
           Nob: and they came all of them to the king.

09:022:012 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
           Here I am, my lord.

09:022:013 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
           and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a
           sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise
           against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

09:022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so
           faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's
           son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in
           thine house?

09:022:015 Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me:
           let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all
           the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all
           this, less or more.

09:022:016 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
           all thy father's house.

09:022:017 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
           and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is
           with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not
           shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put
           forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.

09:022:018 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the
           priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the
           priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that
           did wear a linen ephod.

09:022:019 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of
           the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and
           oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

09:022:020 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
           Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

09:022:021 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's
           priests.

09:022:022 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg
           the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have
           occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

09:022:023 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
           seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

09:023:001 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
           against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

09:023:002 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
           smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and
           smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.

09:023:003 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
           Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the
           armies of the Philistines?

09:023:004 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD
           answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
           deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

09:023:005 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
           Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them
           with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of
           Keilah.

09:023:006 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled
           to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his
           hand.

09:023:007 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
           said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut
           in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

09:023:008 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
           Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

09:023:009 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against
           him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the
           ephod.

09:023:010 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
           certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to
           destroy the city for my sake.

09:023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
           come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I
           beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will
           come down.

09:023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
           into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver
           thee up.

09:023:013 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose
           and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could
           go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;
           and he forbare to go forth.

09:023:014 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and
           remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul
           sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

09:023:015 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
           David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

09:023:016 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the
           wood, and strengthened his hand in God.

09:023:017 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
           shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I
           shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

09:023:018 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode
           in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

09:023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
           David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the
           hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?

09:023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire
           of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him
           into the king's hand.

09:023:021 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have
           compassion on me.

09:023:022 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
           his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me
           that he dealeth very subtilly.

09:023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
           where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the
           certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass,
           if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout
           all the thousands of Judah.

09:023:024 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and
           his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the
           south of Jeshimon.

09:023:025 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
           wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the
           wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after
           David in the wilderness of Maon.

09:023:026 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
           men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get
           away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David
           and his men round about to take them.

09:023:027 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
           come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

09:023:028 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
           against the Philistines: therefore they called that place
           Selahammahlekoth.

09:023:029 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
           Engedi.

09:024:001 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
           Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in
           the wilderness of Engedi.

09:024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
           and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild
           goats.

09:024:003 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave;
           and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men
           remained in the sides of the cave.

09:024:004 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which
           the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy
           into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem
           good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of
           Saul's robe privily.

09:024:005 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him,
           because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

09:024:006 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do
           this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch
           forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the
           LORD.

09:024:007 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered
           them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the
           cave, and went on his way.

09:024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and
           cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul
           looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth,
           and bowed himself.

09:024:009 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
           saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

09:024:010 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had
           delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some
           bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I
           will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the
           LORD's anointed.

09:024:011 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
           hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed
           thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor
           transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against
           thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.

09:024:012 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
           thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

09:024:013 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth
           from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

09:024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost
           thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

09:024:015 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee,
           and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

09:024:016 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
           these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my
           son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

09:024:017 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
           hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

09:024:018 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well
           with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into
           thine hand, thou killedst me not.

09:024:019 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
           wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done
           unto me this day.

09:024:020 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,
           and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine
           hand.

09:024:021 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not
           cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my
           name out of my father's house.

09:024:022 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and
           his men gat them up unto the hold.

09:025:001 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered
           together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at
           Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of
           Paran.

09:025:002 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
           and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
           and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

09:025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
           Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a
           beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in
           his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.

09:025:004 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
           sheep.

09:025:005 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the
           young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet
           him in my name:

09:025:006 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace
           be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be
           unto all that thou hast.

09:025:007 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy
           shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was
           there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in
           Carmel.

09:025:008 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
           young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good
           day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto
           thy servants, and to thy son David.

09:025:009 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according
           to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

09:025:010 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?
           and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days
           that break away every man from his master.

09:025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
           have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know
           not whence they be?

09:025:012 So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and
           came and told him all those sayings.

09:025:013 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.
           And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded
           on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred
           men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.

09:025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,
           Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute
           our master; and he railed on them.

09:025:015 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
           neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant
           with them, when we were in the fields:

09:025:016 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while
           we were with them keeping the sheep.

09:025:017 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
           determined against our master, and against all his household:
           for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to
           him.

09:025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
           bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
           measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins,
           and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

09:025:019 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I
           come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

09:025:020 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by
           the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came
           down against her; and she met them.

09:025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
           fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of
           all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for
           good.

09:025:022 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave
           of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that
           pisseth against the wall.

09:025:023 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the
           ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to
           the ground,

09:025:024 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
           this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
           in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

09:025:025 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
           Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and
           folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men
           of my lord, whom thou didst send.

09:025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
           liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to
           shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now
           let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as
           Nabal.

09:025:027 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto
           my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow
           my lord.

09:025:028 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
           LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord
           fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found
           in thee all thy days.

09:025:029 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but
           the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with
           the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall
           he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.

09:025:030 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
           lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning
           thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;

09:025:031 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart
           unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or
           that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall
           have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.

09:025:032 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
           which sent thee this day to meet me:

09:025:033 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast
           kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging
           myself with mine own hand.

09:025:034 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
           kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and
           come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by
           the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

09:025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
           and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have
           hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

09:025:036 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
           house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry
           within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him
           nothing, less or more, until the morning light.

09:025:037 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
           of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his
           heart died within him, and he became as a stone.

09:025:038 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
           Nabal, that he died.

09:025:039 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
           the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the
           hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the
           LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head.
           And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him
           to wife.

09:025:040 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
           they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take
           thee to him to wife.

09:025:041 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
           said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet
           of the servants of my lord.

09:025:042 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
           damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the
           messengers of David, and became his wife.

09:025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
           them his wives.

09:025:044 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to
           Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

09:026:001 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
           David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
           Jeshimon?

09:026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
           having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek
           David in the wilderness of Ziph.

09:026:003 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
           Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and
           he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

09:026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
           come in very deed.

09:026:005 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
           and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son
           of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench,
           and the people pitched round about him.

09:026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
           Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will
           go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will
           go down with thee.

09:026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
           Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in
           the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round
           about him.

09:026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy
           into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I
           pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I
           will not smite him the second time.

09:026:009 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can
           stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be
           guiltless?

09:026:010 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall
           smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend
           into battle, and perish.

09:026:011 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
           the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear
           that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

09:026:012 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's
           bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew
           it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep
           sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.

09:026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top
           of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:

09:026:014 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
           saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and
           said, Who art thou that criest to the king?

09:026:015 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who
           is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept
           thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to
           destroy the king thy lord.

09:026:016 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD
           liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your
           master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's
           spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.

09:026:017 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my
           son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

09:026:018 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
           servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

09:026:019 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the
           words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against
           me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of
           men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me
           out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD,
           saying, Go, serve other gods.

09:026:020 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
           face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a
           flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

09:026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I
           will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in
           thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have
           erred exceedingly.

09:026:022 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let
           one of the young men come over and fetch it.

09:026:023 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
           faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day,
           but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's
           anointed.

09:026:024 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine
           eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD,
           and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

09:026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
           shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So
           David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

09:027:001 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
           hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I
           should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and
           Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of
           Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.

09:027:002 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men
           that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of
           Gath.

09:027:003 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
           with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the
           Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

09:027:004 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he
           sought no more again for him.

09:027:005 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
           eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country,
           that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in
           the royal city with thee?

09:027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag
           pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

09:027:007 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the
           Philistines was a full year and four months.

09:027:008 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
           the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of
           old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even
           unto the land of Egypt.

09:027:009 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman
           alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses,
           and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to
           Achish.

09:027:010 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
           said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the
           Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.

09:027:011 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings
           to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did
           David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in
           the country of the Philistines.

09:027:012 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
           Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant
           for ever.

09:028:001 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines
           gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with
           Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that
           thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.

09:028:002 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy
           servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I
           make thee keeper of mine head for ever.

09:028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and
           buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put
           away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of
           the land.

09:028:004 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
           pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and
           they pitched in Gilboa.

09:028:005 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
           and his heart greatly trembled.

09:028:006 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
           neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

09:028:007 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
           familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And
           his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a
           familiar spirit at Endor.

09:028:008 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
           went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by
           night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the
           familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto
           thee.

09:028:009 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul
           hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar
           spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then
           layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?

09:028:010 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth,
           there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

09:028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
           said, Bring me up Samuel.

09:028:012 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice:
           and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived
           me? for thou art Saul.

09:028:013 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
           thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out
           of the earth.

09:028:014 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
           man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul
           perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to
           the ground, and bowed himself.

09:028:015 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
           me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the
           Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me,
           and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
           therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto
           me what I shall do.

09:028:016 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing
           the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

09:028:017 And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD
           hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy
           neighbour, even to David:

09:028:018 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor
           executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the
           LORD done this thing unto thee this day.

09:028:019 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
           hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons
           be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel
           into the hand of the Philistines.

09:028:020 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was
           sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no
           strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor
           all the night.

09:028:021 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore
           troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath
           obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have
           hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.

09:028:022 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice
           of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before
           thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest
           on thy way.

09:028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
           together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto
           their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

09:028:024 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
           killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake
           unleavened bread thereof:

09:028:025 And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and
           they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

09:029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to
           Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in
           Jezreel.

09:029:002 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
           thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward
           with Achish.

09:029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these
           Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the
           Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king
           of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years,
           and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto
           this day?

09:029:004 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and
           the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow
           return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast
           appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest
           in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should
           he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with
           the heads of these men?

09:029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
           saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

09:029:006 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the
           LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy
           coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have
           not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me
           unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

09:029:007 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
           the lords of the Philistines.

09:029:008 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what
           hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with
           thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the
           enemies of my lord the king?

09:029:009 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art
           good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the
           princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with
           us to the battle.

09:029:010 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
           servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up
           early in the morning, and have light, depart.

09:029:011 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning,
           to return into the land of the Philistines. And the
           Philistines went up to Jezreel.

09:030:001 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to
           Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the
           south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with
           fire;

09:030:002 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew
           not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and
           went on their way.

09:030:003 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was
           burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their
           daughters, were taken captives.

09:030:004 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
           voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

09:030:005 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
           Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

09:030:006 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of
           stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved,
           every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David
           encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

09:030:007 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray
           thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither
           the ephod to David.

09:030:008 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after
           this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him,
           Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail
           recover all.

09:030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him,
           and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind
           stayed.

09:030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
           abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over
           the brook Besor.

09:030:011 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
           David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him
           drink water;

09:030:012 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters
           of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to
           him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three
           days and three nights.

09:030:013 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence
           art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to
           an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone
           I fell sick.

09:030:014 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and
           upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of
           Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

09:030:015 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this
           company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt
           neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master,
           and I will bring thee down to this company.

09:030:016 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
           abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,
           because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the
           land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

09:030:017 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening
           of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save
           four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

09:030:018 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
           and David rescued his two wives.

09:030:019 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor
           great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any
           thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.

09:030:020 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
           before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

09:030:021 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint
           that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to
           abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David,
           and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came
           near to the people, he saluted them.

09:030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
           that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us,
           we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have
           recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that
           they may lead them away, and depart.

09:030:023 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
           which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and
           delivered the company that came against us into our hand.

09:030:024 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part
           is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that
           tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.

09:030:025 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
           and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

09:030:026 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
           elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present
           for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;

09:030:027 To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south
           Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,

09:030:028 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in
           Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

09:030:029 And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in
           the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the
           cities of the Kenites,

09:030:030 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
           Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,

09:030:031 And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where
           David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

09:031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of
           Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
           in mount Gilboa.

09:031:002 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
           and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
           Melchishua, Saul's sons.

09:031:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
           him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.

09:031:004 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and
           thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and
           thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would
           not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and
           fell upon it.

09:031:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
           likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

09:031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and
           all his men, that same day together.

09:031:007 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
           valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that
           the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
           they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came
           and dwelt in them.

09:031:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
           to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons
           fallen in mount Gilboa.

09:031:009 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and
           sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish
           it in the house of their idols, and among the people.

09:031:010 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
           fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.

09:031:011 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which
           the Philistines had done to Saul;

09:031:012 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
           body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of
           Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

09:031:013 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
           Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

Book 10        2 Samuel

10:001:001 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
           returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
           abode two days in Ziklag;

10:001:002 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
           came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and
           earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David,
           that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

10:001:003 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
           unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

10:001:004 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
           tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the
           battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and
           Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

10:001:005 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
           thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

10:001:006 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
           upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,
           lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

10:001:007 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
           And I answered, Here am I.

10:001:008 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
           Amalekite.

10:001:009 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
           me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole
           in me.

10:001:010 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
           could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
           that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,
           and have brought them hither unto my lord.

10:001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and
           likewise all the men that were with him:

10:001:012 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
           and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and
           for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the
           sword.

10:001:013 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art
           thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an
           Amalekite.

10:001:014 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
           forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?

10:001:015 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and
           fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

10:001:016 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
           mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
           LORD's anointed.

10:001:017 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
           Jonathan his son:

10:001:018 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
           bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

10:001:019 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are
           the mighty fallen!

10:001:020 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;
           lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the
           daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

10:001:021 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
           be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the
           shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,
           as though he had not been anointed with oil.

10:001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the
           bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul
           returned not empty.

10:001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and
           in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
           eagles, they were stronger than lions.

10:001:024 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
           scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold
           upon your apparel.

10:001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O
           Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.

10:001:026 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
           hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing
           the love of women.

10:001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

10:002:001 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the
           LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?
           And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither
           shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

10:002:002 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
           Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

10:002:003 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man
           with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

10:002:004 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
           over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the
           men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

10:002:005 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and
           said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed
           this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried
           him.

10:002:006 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also
           will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this
           thing.

10:002:007 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye
           valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of
           Judah have anointed me king over them.

10:002:008 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took
           Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

10:002:009 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and
           over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over
           all Israel.

10:002:010 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to
           reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of
           Judah followed David.

10:002:011 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
           Judah was seven years and six months.

10:002:012 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the
           son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

10:002:013 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went
           out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat
           down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on
           the other side of the pool.

10:002:014 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
           before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

10:002:015 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
           which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of
           the servants of David.

10:002:016 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust
           his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
           wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in
           Gibeon.

10:002:017 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was
           beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

10:002:018 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
           and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

10:002:019 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to
           the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

10:002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And
           he answered, I am.

10:002:021 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
           thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take
           thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from
           following of him.

10:002:022 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
           me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then
           should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?

10:002:023 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the
           hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that
           the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and
           died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as
           came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

10:002:024 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went
           down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth
           before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

10:002:025 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
           after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an
           hill.

10:002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour
           for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the
           latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people
           return from following their brethren?

10:002:027 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely
           then in the morning the people had gone up every one from
           following his brother.

10:002:028 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
           pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

10:002:029 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
           and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they
           came to Mahanaim.

10:002:030 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had
           gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's
           servants nineteen men and Asahel.

10:002:031 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of
           Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

10:002:032 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of
           his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went
           all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

10:003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
           of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house
           of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

10:003:002 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was
           Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

10:003:003 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the
           Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the
           daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;

10:003:004 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
           Shephatiah the son of Abital;

10:003:005 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born
           to David in Hebron.

10:003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of
           Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
           for the house of Saul.

10:003:007 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
           of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou
           gone in unto my father's concubine?

10:003:008 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and
           said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness
           this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,
           and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand
           of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning
           this woman?

10:003:009 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath
           sworn to David, even so I do to him;

10:003:010 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up
           the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even
           to Beersheba.

10:003:011 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
           him.

10:003:012 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,
           Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and,
           behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel
           unto thee.

10:003:013 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one
           thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,
           except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou
           comest to see my face.

10:003:014 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,
           Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an
           hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

10:003:015 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
           Phaltiel the son of Laish.

10:003:016 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
           Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he
           returned.

10:003:017 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
           Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:

10:003:018 Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By
           the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out
           of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all
           their enemies.

10:003:019 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
           also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
           good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of
           Benjamin.

10:003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
           David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

10:003:021 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will
           gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a
           league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that
           thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went
           in peace.

10:003:022 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing
           a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was
           not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was
           gone in peace.

10:003:023 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they
           told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and
           he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

10:003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
           behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent
           him away, and he is quite gone?

10:003:025 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive
           thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know
           all that thou doest.

10:003:026 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
           after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah:
           but David knew it not.

10:003:027 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in
           the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under
           the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his
           brother.

10:003:028 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
           are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner
           the son of Ner:

10:003:029 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's
           house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that
           hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,
           or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

10:003:030 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had
           slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

10:003:031 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with
           him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
           before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.

10:003:032 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
           voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people
           wept.

10:003:033 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
           fool dieth?

10:003:034 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a
           man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the
           people wept again over him.

10:003:035 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while
           it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more
           also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

10:003:036 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
           whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

10:003:037 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
           was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

10:003:038 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is
           a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

10:003:039 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
           the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward
           the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

10:004:001 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his
           hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

10:004:002 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the
           name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
           the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:
           (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.

10:004:003 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
           until this day.)

10:004:004 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.
           He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and
           Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled:
           and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
           and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

10:004:005 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,
           went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of
           Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.

10:004:006 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though
           they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the
           fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

10:004:007 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
           bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded
           him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain
           all night.

10:004:008 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,
           and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of
           Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath
           avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

10:004:009 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
           Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth,
           who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

10:004:010 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to
           have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in
           Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for
           his tidings:

10:004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
           in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now
           require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
           earth?

10:004:012 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut
           off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the
           pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and
           buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

10:005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
           spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

10:005:002 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he
           that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said
           to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a
           captain over Israel.

10:005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and
           king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:
           and they anointed David king over Israel.

10:005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned forty years.

10:005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
           and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all
           Israel and Judah.

10:005:006 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,
           the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,
           Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not
           come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.

10:005:007 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is
           the city of David.

10:005:008 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the
           gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind
           that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.
           Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come
           into the house.

10:005:009 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.
           And David built round about from Millo and inward.

10:005:010 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts
           was with him.

10:005:011 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar
           trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an
           house.

10:005:012 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king
           over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his
           people Israel's sake.

10:005:013 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
           after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and
           daughters born to David.

10:005:014 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
           Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

10:005:015 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

10:005:016 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

10:005:017 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David
           king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David;
           and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.

10:005:018 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley
           of Rephaim.

10:005:019 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
           Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the
           LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the
           Philistines into thine hand.

10:005:020 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
           said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me,
           as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that
           place Baalperazim.

10:005:021 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
           them.

10:005:022 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
           in the valley of Rephaim.

10:005:023 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not
           go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them
           over against the mulberry trees.

10:005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the
           tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir
           thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite
           the host of the Philistines.

10:005:025 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
           Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

10:006:001 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
           thirty thousand.

10:006:002 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with
           him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of
           God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts
           that dwelleth between the cherubims.

10:006:003 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it
           out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and
           Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

10:006:004 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
           Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the
           ark.

10:006:005 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD
           on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps,
           and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on
           cymbals.

10:006:006 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth
           his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen
           shook it.

10:006:007 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God
           smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of
           God.

10:006:008 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
           upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to
           this day.

10:006:009 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall
           the ark of the LORD come to me?

10:006:010 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into
           the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house
           of Obededom the Gittite.

10:006:011 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
           Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all
           his household.

10:006:012 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
           house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because
           of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God
           from the house of Obededom into the city of David with
           gladness.

10:006:013 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD
           had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

10:006:014 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
           was girded with a linen ephod.

10:006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
           LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

10:006:016 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
           Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David
           leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in
           her heart.

10:006:017 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his
           place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched
           for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
           before the LORD.

10:006:018 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt
           offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
           name of the LORD of hosts.

10:006:019 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole
           multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one
           a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of
           wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.

10:006:020 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
           daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How
           glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself
           to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of
           the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!

10:006:021 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which
           chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to
           appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:
           therefore will I play before the LORD.

10:006:022 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in
           mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken
           of, of them shall I be had in honour.

10:006:023 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the
           day of her death.

10:007:001 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the
           LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;

10:007:002 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
           in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within
           curtains.

10:007:003 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine
           heart; for the LORD is with thee.

10:007:004 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
           unto Nathan, saying,

10:007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou
           build me an house for me to dwell in?

10:007:006 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I
           brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this
           day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

10:007:007 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children
           of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
           whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build
           ye not me an house of cedar?

10:007:008 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
           saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from
           following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:

10:007:009 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut
           off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a
           great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in
           the earth.

10:007:010 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
           plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and
           move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict
           them any more, as beforetime,

10:007:011 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
           people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine
           enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an
           house.

10:007:012 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
           fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall
           proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

10:007:013 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
           throne of his kingdom for ever.

10:007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
           iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the
           stripes of the children of men:

10:007:015 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from
           Saul, whom I put away before thee.

10:007:016 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
           before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

10:007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this
           vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

10:007:018 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
           Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast
           brought me hitherto?

10:007:019 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but
           thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while
           to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

10:007:020 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,
           knowest thy servant.

10:007:021 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast
           thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know
           them.

10:007:022 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
           thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all
           that we have heard with our ears.

10:007:023 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
           Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and
           to make him a name, and to do for you great things and
           terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou
           redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their
           gods?

10:007:024 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a
           people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their
           God.

10:007:025 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
           thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,
           and do as thou hast said.

10:007:026 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of
           hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant
           David be established before thee.

10:007:027 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
           servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath
           thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

10:007:028 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
           and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

10:007:029 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy
           servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,
           O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the
           house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

10:008:001 And after this it came to pass that David smote the
           Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out
           of the hand of the Philistines.

10:008:002 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
           down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to
           death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the
           Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

10:008:003 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
           as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

10:008:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
           horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all
           the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred
           chariots.

10:008:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer
           king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty
           thousand men.

10:008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
           became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD
           preserved David whithersoever he went.

10:008:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
           of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

10:008:008 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
           David took exceeding much brass.

10:008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the
           host of Hadadezer,

10:008:010 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him,
           and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and
           smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram
           brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
           vessels of brass:

10:008:011 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the
           silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he
           subdued;

10:008:012 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
           the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
           son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

10:008:013 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
           Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

10:008:014 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
           garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And
           the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

10:008:015 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
           and justice unto all his people.

10:008:016 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
           the son of Ahilud was recorder;

10:008:017 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of
           Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

10:008:018 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites
           and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

10:009:001 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
           Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

10:009:002 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was
           Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said
           unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.

10:009:003 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul,
           that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said
           unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his
           feet.

10:009:004 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto
           the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of
           Ammiel, in Lodebar.

10:009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of
           Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

10:009:006 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
           was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.
           And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy
           servant!

10:009:007 And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee
           kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee
           all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at
           my table continually.

10:009:008 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
           shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?

10:009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto
           him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to
           Saul and to all his house.

10:009:010 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
           land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy
           master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy
           master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had
           fifteen sons and twenty servants.

10:009:011 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord
           the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.
           As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table,
           as one of the king's sons.

10:009:012 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And
           all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto
           Mephibosheth.

10:009:013 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually
           at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

10:010:001 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children
           of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

10:010:002 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
           Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent
           to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And
           David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

10:010:003 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
           lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he
           hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his
           servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and
           to overthrow it?

10:010:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
           half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the
           middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

10:010:005 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because
           the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at
           Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

10:010:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before
           David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of
           Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,
           and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve
           thousand men.

10:010:007 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
           the mighty men.

10:010:008 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
           array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba,
           and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in
           the field.

10:010:009 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him
           before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
           and put them in array against the Syrians:

10:010:010 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of
           Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against
           the children of Ammon.

10:010:011 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
           shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
           thee, then I will come and help thee.

10:010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,
           and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which
           seemeth him good.

10:010:013 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto
           the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

10:010:014 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
           then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.
           So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to
           Jerusalem.

10:010:015 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
           they gathered themselves together.

10:010:016 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were
           beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the
           captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

10:010:017 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together,
           and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set
           themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

10:010:018 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
           seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand
           horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who
           died there.

10:010:019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw
           that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with
           Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the
           children of Ammon any more.

10:011:001 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
           when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his
           servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the
           children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried
           still at Jerusalem.

10:011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from
           off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and
           from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman
           was very beautiful to look upon.

10:011:003 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is
           not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah
           the Hittite?

10:011:004 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
           him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her
           uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.

10:011:005 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I
           am with child.

10:011:006 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
           Joab sent Uriah to David.

10:011:007 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how
           Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

10:011:008 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy
           feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there
           followed him a mess of meat from the king.

10:011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
           servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

10:011:010 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
           his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy
           journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?

10:011:011 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
           abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
           are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine
           house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou
           livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.

10:011:012 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow
           I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
           and the morrow.

10:011:013 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before
           him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on
           his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to
           his house.

10:011:014 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter
           to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

10:011:015 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
           forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that
           he may be smitten, and die.

10:011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
           assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men
           were.

10:011:017 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
           there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and
           Uriah the Hittite died also.

10:011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the
           war;

10:011:019 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end
           of telling the matters of the war unto the king,

10:011:020 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto
           thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye
           did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

10:011:021 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman
           cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he
           died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy
           servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

10:011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
           had sent him for.

10:011:023 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
           against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were
           upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

10:011:024 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
           some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the
           Hittite is dead also.

10:011:025 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
           Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword
           devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong
           against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

10:011:026 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
           dead, she mourned for her husband.

10:011:027 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
           his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But
           the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

10:012:001 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
           said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,
           and the other poor.

10:012:002 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

10:012:003 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which
           he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with
           him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and
           drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him
           as a daughter.

10:012:004 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
           take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the
           wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's
           lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

10:012:005 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
           said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done
           this thing shall surely die:

10:012:006 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
           thing, and because he had no pity.

10:012:007 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the
           LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I
           delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

10:012:008 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives
           into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of
           Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have
           given unto thee such and such things.

10:012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to
           do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with
           the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast
           slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.

10:012:010 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
           because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of
           Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

10:012:011 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
           out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
           eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with
           thy wives in the sight of this sun.

10:012:012 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before
           all Israel, and before the sun.

10:012:013 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.
           And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy
           sin; thou shalt not die.

10:012:014 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion
           to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that
           is born unto thee shall surely die.

10:012:015 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
           child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

10:012:016 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
           and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

10:012:017 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise
           him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat
           bread with them.

10:012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.
           And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child
           was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet
           alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our
           voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
           child is dead?

10:012:019 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David
           perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto
           his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

10:012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
           himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of
           the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and
           when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

10:012:021 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
           hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it
           was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and
           eat bread.

10:012:022 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
           for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me,
           that the child may live?

10:012:023 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him
           back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

10:012:024 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
           and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name
           Solomon: and the LORD loved him.

10:012:025 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called
           his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

10:012:026 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
           took the royal city.

10:012:027 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
           against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

10:012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and
           encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city,
           and it be called after my name.

10:012:029 And David gathered all the people together, and went to
           Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

10:012:030 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight
           whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it
           was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the
           city in great abundance.

10:012:031 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put
           them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of
           iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did
           he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and
           all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

10:013:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
           had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of
           David loved her.

10:013:002 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister
           Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him
           to do anything to her.

10:013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
           Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

10:013:004 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean
           from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto
           him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

10:013:005 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
           thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto
           him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat,
           and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it
           at her hand.

10:013:006 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king
           was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee,
           let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my
           sight, that I may eat at her hand.

10:013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
           Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

10:013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid
           down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in
           his sight, and did bake the cakes.

10:013:009 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
           refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And
           they went out every man from him.

10:013:010 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber,
           that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which
           she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her
           brother.

10:013:011 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
           her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

10:013:012 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
           such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

10:013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
           thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I
           pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me
           from thee.

10:013:014 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being
           stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.

10:013:015 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
           he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved
           her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

10:013:016 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
           me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But
           he would not hearken unto her.

10:013:017 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
           Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

10:013:018 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with
           such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins
           apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the
           door after her.

10:013:019 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of
           divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head,
           and went on crying.

10:013:020 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
           been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy
           brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in
           her brother Absalom's house.

10:013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
           wroth.

10:013:022 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
           for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister
           Tamar.

10:013:023 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
           sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and
           Absalom invited all the king's sons.

10:013:024 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy
           servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and
           his servants go with thy servant.

10:013:025 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
           go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him:
           howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

10:013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon
           go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with
           thee?

10:013:027 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's
           sons go with him.

10:013:028 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now
           when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto
           you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I
           commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

10:013:029 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
           commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat
           him up upon his mule, and fled.

10:013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
           came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,
           and there is not one of them left.

10:013:031 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
           earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

10:013:032 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and
           said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the
           young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the
           appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day
           that he forced his sister Tamar.

10:013:033 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
           heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon
           only is dead.

10:013:034 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
           up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people
           by the way of the hill side behind him.

10:013:035 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come:
           as thy servant said, so it is.

10:013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of
           speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up
           their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants
           wept very sore.

10:013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
           of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

10:013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three
           years.

10:013:039 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom:
           for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

10:014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
           was toward Absalom.

10:014:002 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
           said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and
           put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil,
           but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:

10:014:003 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So
           Joab put the words in her mouth.

10:014:004 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on
           her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O
           king.

10:014:005 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
           answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

10:014:006 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
           the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote
           the other, and slew him.

10:014:007 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
           and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may
           kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we
           will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal
           which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name
           nor remainder upon the earth.

10:014:008 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I
           will give charge concerning thee.

10:014:009 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,
           the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king
           and his throne be guiltless.

10:014:010 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
           me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

10:014:011 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
           God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to
           destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As
           the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to
           the earth.

10:014:012 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
           one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

10:014:013 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
           thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this
           thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch
           home again his banished.

10:014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
           which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect
           any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not
           expelled from him.

10:014:015 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my
           lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
           and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may
           be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.

10:014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the
           hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out
           of the inheritance of God.

10:014:017 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall
           now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the
           king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will
           be with thee.

10:014:018 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
           me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the
           woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.

10:014:019 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
           this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my
           lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left
           from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant
           Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of
           thine handmaid:

10:014:020 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done
           this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an
           angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.

10:014:021 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this
           thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

10:014:022 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself,
           and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant
           knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king,
           in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.

10:014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
           Jerusalem.

10:014:024 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
           not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw
           not the king's face.

10:014:025 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
           Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the
           crown of his head there was no blemish in him.

10:014:026 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end
           that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,
           therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at
           two hundred shekels after the king's weight.

10:014:027 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
           whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

10:014:028 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
           king's face.

10:014:029 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
           but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the
           second time, he would not come.

10:014:030 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
           mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And
           Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

10:014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
           unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

10:014:032 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,
           Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say,
           Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to
           have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's
           face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.

10:014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
           for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his
           face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed
           Absalom.

10:015:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
           chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

10:015:002 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the
           gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy
           came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him,
           and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is
           of one of the tribes of Israel.

10:015:003 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and
           right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

10:015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
           that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto
           me, and I would do him justice!

10:015:005 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him
           obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed
           him.

10:015:006 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
           king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of
           Israel.

10:015:007 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto
           the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have
           vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.

10:015:008 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
           saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
           then I will serve the LORD.

10:015:009 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went
           to Hebron.

10:015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
           saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye
           shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

10:015:011 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
           were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew
           not any thing.

10:015:012 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's
           counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered
           sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people
           increased continually with Absalom.

10:015:013 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
           men of Israel are after Absalom.

10:015:014 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
           Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else
           escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us
           suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the
           edge of the sword.

10:015:015 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy
           servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall
           appoint.

10:015:016 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
           the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the
           house.

10:015:017 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
           tarried in a place that was far off.

10:015:018 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
           Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six
           hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before
           the king.

10:015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
           also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:
           for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.

10:015:020 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
           go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return
           thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with
           thee.

10:015:021 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
           as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the
           king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will
           thy servant be.

10:015:022 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the
           Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones
           that were with him.

10:015:023 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
           passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook
           Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
           wilderness.

10:015:024 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
           the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of
           God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done
           passing out of the city.

10:015:025 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into
           the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he
           will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:

10:015:026 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am
           I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

10:015:027 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
           return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
           Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

10:015:028 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
           come word from you to certify me.

10:015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
           Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

10:015:030 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as
           he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:
           and all the people that was with him covered every man his
           head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

10:015:031 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the
           conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray
           thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

10:015:032 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of
           the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite
           came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

10:015:033 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou
           shalt be a burden unto me:

10:015:034 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will
           be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant
           hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou
           for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

10:015:035 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
           priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou
           shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to
           Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

10:015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
           Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall
           send unto me every thing that ye can hear.

10:015:037 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came
           into Jerusalem.

10:016:001 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
           Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of
           asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and
           an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer
           fruits, and a bottle of wine.

10:016:002 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And
           Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on;
           and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and
           the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

10:016:003 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba
           said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he
           said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom
           of my father.

10:016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that
           pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech
           thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

10:016:005 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
           man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei,
           the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

10:016:006 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
           David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his
           right hand and on his left.

10:016:007 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
           bloody man, and thou man of Belial:

10:016:008 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of
           Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath
           delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,
           behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a
           bloody man.

10:016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
           this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray
           thee, and take off his head.

10:016:010 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
           Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto
           him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done
           so?

10:016:011 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my
           son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much
           more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him
           curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.

10:016:012 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
           the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

10:016:013 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
           the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and
           threw stones at him, and cast dust.

10:016:014 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came
           weary, and refreshed themselves there.

10:016:015 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
           Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

10:016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,
           was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save
           the king, God save the king.

10:016:017 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy
           friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?

10:016:018 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this
           people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and
           with him will I abide.

10:016:019 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
           presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's
           presence, so will I be in thy presence.

10:016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what
           we shall do.

10:016:021 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
           concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all
           Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then
           shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

10:016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
           Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of
           all Israel.

10:016:023 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
           days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so
           was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with
           Absalom.

10:017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
           twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David
           this night:

10:017:002 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed,
           and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him
           shall flee; and I will smite the king only:

10:017:003 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom
           thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be
           in peace.

10:017:004 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
           Israel.

10:017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
           us hear likewise what he saith.

10:017:006 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
           saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do
           after his saying? if not; speak thou.

10:017:007 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
           given is not good at this time.

10:017:008 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that
           they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a
           bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a
           man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

10:017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and
           it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the
           first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a
           slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.

10:017:010 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
           lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy
           father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant
           men.

10:017:011 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
           thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the
           sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own
           person.

10:017:012 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be
           found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the
           ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there
           shall not be left so much as one.

10:017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
           bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
           until there be not one small stone found there.

10:017:014 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
           Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
           For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of
           Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon
           Absalom.

10:017:015 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
           and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of
           Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.

10:017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
           this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass
           over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that
           are with him.

10:017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
           be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them;
           and they went and told king David.

10:017:018 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
           both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in
           Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went
           down.

10:017:019 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's
           mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not
           known.

10:017:020 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,
           they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said
           unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they
           had sought and could not find them, they returned to
           Jerusalem.

10:017:021 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came
           up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said
           unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus
           hath Ahithophel counselled against you.

10:017:022 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
           they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not
           one of them that was not gone over Jordan.

10:017:023 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
           saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to
           his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,
           and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

10:017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan,
           he and all the men of Israel with him.

10:017:025 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
           which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an
           Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
           sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

10:017:026 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

10:017:027 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that
           Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
           and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the
           Gileadite of Rogelim,

10:017:028 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
           barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles,
           and parched pulse,

10:017:029 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for
           David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they
           said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
           wilderness.

10:018:001 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
           captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

10:018:002 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand
           of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of
           Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of
           Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will
           surely go forth with you myself also.

10:018:003 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
           flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us
           die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten
           thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour
           us out of the city.

10:018:004 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
           And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came
           out by hundreds and by thousands.

10:018:005 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
           Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
           And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains
           charge concerning Absalom.

10:018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
           battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

10:018:007 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
           David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
           twenty thousand men.

10:018:008 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
           country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the
           sword devoured.

10:018:009 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
           mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
           and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up
           between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under
           him went away.

10:018:010 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I
           saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

10:018:011 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
           sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the
           ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and
           a girdle.

10:018:012 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
           shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine
           hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king
           charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
           touch the young man Absalom.

10:018:013 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own
           life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou
           thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.

10:018:014 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
           three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
           Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

10:018:015 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and
           smote Absalom, and slew him.

10:018:016 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from
           pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

10:018:017 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
           wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all
           Israel fled every one to his tent.

10:018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for
           himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I
           have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the
           pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day,
           Absalom's place.

10:018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
           the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his
           enemies.

10:018:020 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
           but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou
           shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

10:018:021 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
           And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

10:018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
           howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab
           said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast
           no tidings ready?

10:018:023 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run.
           Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

10:018:024 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up
           to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his
           eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

10:018:025 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said,
           If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came
           apace, and drew near.

10:018:026 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
           called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running
           alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

10:018:027 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
           is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king
           said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

10:018:028 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And
           he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and
           said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the
           men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

10:018:029 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
           answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy
           servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

10:018:030 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
           turned aside, and stood still.

10:018:031 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
           king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that
           rose up against thee.

10:018:032 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?
           And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all
           that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man
           is.

10:018:033 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over
           the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son
           Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for
           thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

10:019:001 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth
           for Absalom.

10:019:002 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
           people: for the people heard say that day how the king was
           grieved for his son.

10:019:003 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
           people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

10:019:004 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
           voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

10:019:005 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast
           shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day
           have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy
           daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy
           concubines;

10:019:006 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For
           thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither
           princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom
           had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased
           thee well.

10:019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
           servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there
           will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be
           worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy
           youth until now.

10:019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto
           all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.
           And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled
           every man to his tent.

10:019:009 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
           Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our
           enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the
           Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.

10:019:010 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
           therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

10:019:011 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
           saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the
           last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of
           all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.

10:019:012 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore
           then are ye the last to bring back the king?

10:019:013 And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?
           God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the
           host before me continually in the room of Joab.

10:019:014 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
           heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king,
           Return thou, and all thy servants.

10:019:015 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
           Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over
           Jordan.

10:019:016 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
           hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

10:019:017 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
           the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
           twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the
           king.

10:019:018 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
           household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son
           of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

10:019:019 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto
           me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did
           perversely the day that my lord the king went out of
           Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

10:019:020 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,
           behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of
           Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

10:019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
           Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's
           anointed?

10:019:022 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
           Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall
           there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I
           know that I am this day king over Israel?

10:019:023 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And
           the king sware unto him.

10:019:024 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,
           and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor
           washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the
           day he came again in peace.

10:019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
           king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou
           with me, Mephibosheth?

10:019:026 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for
           thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride
           thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.

10:019:027 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but
           my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is
           good in thine eyes.

10:019:028 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord
           the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did
           eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry
           any more unto the king?

10:019:029 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy
           matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

10:019:030 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
           forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his
           own house.

10:019:031 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
           over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

10:019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old:
           and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at
           Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.

10:019:033 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and
           I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

10:019:034 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,
           that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

10:019:035 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between
           good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I
           drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and
           singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a
           burden unto my lord the king?

10:019:036 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:
           and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

10:019:037 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die
           in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and
           of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over
           with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto
           thee.

10:019:038 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I
           will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and
           whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

10:019:039 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was
           come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he
           returned unto his own place.

10:019:040 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
           and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half
           the people of Israel.

10:019:041 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
           unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen
           thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and
           all David's men with him, over Jordan?

10:019:042 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because
           the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for
           this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath
           he given us any gift?

10:019:043 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We
           have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in
           David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice
           should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the
           words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the
           men of Israel.

10:020:001 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
           Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet,
           and said, We have no part in David, neither have we
           inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O
           Israel.

10:020:002 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
           Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their
           king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

10:020:003 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took
           the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the
           house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in
           unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death,
           living in widowhood.

10:020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah
           within three days, and be thou here present.

10:020:005 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried
           longer than the set time which he had appointed him.

10:020:006 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri
           do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's
           servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities,
           and escape us.

10:020:007 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites,
           and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out
           of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

10:020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa
           went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was
           girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened
           upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it
           fell out.

10:020:009 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And
           Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

10:020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
           so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his
           bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
           So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of
           Bichri.

10:020:011 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that
           favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after
           Joab.

10:020:012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
           when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed
           Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon
           him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.

10:020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
           after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

10:020:014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
           Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered
           together, and went also after him.

10:020:015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and
           they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the
           trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the
           wall, to throw it down.

10:020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I
           pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with
           thee.

10:020:017 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
           Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear
           the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

10:020:018 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
           saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they
           ended the matter.

10:020:019 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
           thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why
           wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

10:020:020 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that
           I should swallow up or destroy.

10:020:021 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the
           son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the
           king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart
           from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head
           shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

10:020:022 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And
           they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it
           out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the
           city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem
           unto the king.

10:020:023 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son
           of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

10:020:024 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of
           Ahilud was recorder:

10:020:025 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:

10:020:026 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

10:021:001 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
           after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD
           answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he
           slew the Gibeonites.

10:021:002 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now
           the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the
           remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn
           unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the
           children of Israel and Judah.)

10:021:003 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
           you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may
           bless the inheritance of the LORD?

10:021:004 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor
           gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill
           any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I
           do for you.

10:021:005 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
           devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining
           in any of the coasts of Israel,

10:021:006 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will
           hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD
           did choose. And the king said, I will give them.

10:021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
           of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them,
           between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.

10:021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
           whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
           sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for
           Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:

10:021:009 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and
           they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell
           all seven together, and were put to death in the days of
           harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley
           harvest.

10:021:010 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
           for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until
           water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither
           the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of
           the field by night.

10:021:011 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
           concubine of Saul, had done.

10:021:012 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
           Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had
           stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines
           had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in
           Gilboa:

10:021:013 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones
           of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that
           were hanged.

10:021:014 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
           country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his
           father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And
           after that God was intreated for the land.

10:021:015 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
           David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against
           the Philistines: and David waxed faint.

10:021:016 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
           of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in
           weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have
           slain David.

10:021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
           Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto
           him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that
           thou quench not the light of Israel.

10:021:018 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
           with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite
           slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.

10:021:019 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,
           where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the
           brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was
           like a weaver's beam.

10:021:020 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
           stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot
           six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to
           the giant.

10:021:021 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
           brother of David slew him.

10:021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the
           hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

10:022:001 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the
           day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his
           enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

10:022:002 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my
           deliverer;

10:022:003 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and
           the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my
           saviour; thou savest me from violence.

10:022:004 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall
           I be saved from mine enemies.

10:022:005 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly
           men made me afraid;

10:022:006 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death
           prevented me;

10:022:007 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God:
           and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did
           enter into his ears.

10:022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
           moved and shook, because he was wroth.

10:022:009 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
           mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

10:022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was
           under his feet.

10:022:011 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon
           the wings of the wind.

10:022:012 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
           and thick clouds of the skies.

10:022:013 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

10:022:014 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
           voice.

10:022:015 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
           discomfited them.

10:022:016 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
           world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the
           blast of the breath of his nostrils.

10:022:017 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

10:022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
           me: for they were too strong for me.

10:022:019 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
           my stay.

10:022:020 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
           because he delighted in me.

10:022:021 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according
           to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

10:022:022 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
           departed from my God.

10:022:023 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes,
           I did not depart from them.

10:022:024 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
           iniquity.

10:022:025 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
           righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

10:022:026 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with
           the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

10:022:027 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
           froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

10:022:028 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are
           upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

10:022:029 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
           darkness.

10:022:030 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I
           leaped over a wall.

10:022:031 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
           he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

10:022:032 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our
           God?

10:022:033 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

10:022:034 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my
           high places.

10:022:035 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken
           by mine arms.

10:022:036 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
           gentleness hath made me great.

10:022:037 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
           slip.

10:022:038 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned
           not again until I had consumed them.

10:022:039 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could
           not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

10:022:040 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that
           rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.

10:022:041 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I
           might destroy them that hate me.

10:022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD,
           but he answered them not.

10:022:043 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
           stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them
           abroad.

10:022:044 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
           thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I
           knew not shall serve me.

10:022:045 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they
           hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

10:022:046 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of
           their close places.

10:022:047 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the
           God of the rock of my salvation.

10:022:048 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
           under me.

10:022:049 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
           lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou
           hast delivered me from the violent man.

10:022:050 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
           heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

10:022:051 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy
           to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

10:023:001 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
           said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of
           the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

10:023:002 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my
           tongue.

10:023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He
           that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

10:023:004 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun
           riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass
           springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

10:023:005 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me
           an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for
           this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make
           it not to grow.

10:023:006 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
           away, because they cannot be taken with hands:

10:023:007 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and
           the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with
           fire in the same place.

10:023:008 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The
           Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the
           same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight
           hundred, whom he slew at one time.

10:023:009 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of
           the three mighty men with David, when they defied the
           Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and
           the men of Israel were gone away:

10:023:010 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary,
           and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a
           great victory that day; and the people returned after him only
           to spoil.

10:023:011 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And
           the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was
           a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from
           the Philistines.

10:023:012 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
           slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.

10:023:013 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
           the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of
           the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

10:023:014 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
           Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

10:023:015 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
           the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!

10:023:016 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the
           Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that
           was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
           nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out
           unto the LORD.

10:023:017 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
           is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of
           their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did
           these three mighty men.

10:023:018 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was
           chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three
           hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.

10:023:019 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
           captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

10:023:020 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
           Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of
           Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit
           in time of snow:

10:023:021 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
           spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and
           plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him
           with his own spear.

10:023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
           among three mighty men.

10:023:023 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
           the first three. And David set him over his guard.

10:023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
           son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

10:023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

10:023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

10:023:027 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

10:023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

10:023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of
           Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,

10:023:030 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,

10:023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,

10:023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

10:023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,

10:023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,
           Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

10:023:035 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,

10:023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

10:023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to
           Joab the son of Zeruiah,

10:023:038 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,

10:023:039 Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

10:024:001 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,
           and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and
           Judah.

10:024:002 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was
           with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan
           even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know
           the number of the people.

10:024:003 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
           people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the
           eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the
           king delight in this thing?

10:024:004 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and
           against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of
           the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the
           people of Israel.

10:024:005 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the
           right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of
           Gad, and toward Jazer:

10:024:006 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and
           they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,

10:024:007 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of
           the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the
           south of Judah, even to Beersheba.

10:024:008 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
           Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

10:024:009 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
           king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
           men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
           hundred thousand men.

10:024:010 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the
           people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in
           that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away
           the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

10:024:011 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD
           came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

10:024:012 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
           things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

10:024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
           seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou
           flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue
           thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now
           advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent
           me.

10:024:014 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall
           now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and
           let me not fall into the hand of man.

10:024:015 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning
           even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from
           Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.

10:024:016 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
           destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the
           angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine
           hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of
           Araunah the Jebusite.

10:024:017 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
           the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done
           wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine
           hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's
           house.

10:024:018 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
           an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the
           Jebusite.

10:024:019 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
           commanded.

10:024:020 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming
           on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before
           the king on his face upon the ground.

10:024:021 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
           servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to
           build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed
           from the people.

10:024:022 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and
           offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for
           burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other
           instruments of the oxen for wood.

10:024:023 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.
           And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.

10:024:024 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it
           of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto
           the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David
           bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
           silver.

10:024:025 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
           burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated
           for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

Book 11        1 Kings

11:001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
           him with clothes, but he gat no heat.

11:001:002 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for
           my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the
           king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom,
           that my lord the king may get heat.

11:001:003 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
           Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the
           king.

11:001:004 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
           ministered to him: but the king knew her not.

11:001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I
           will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and
           fifty men to run before him.

11:001:006 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
           Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and
           his mother bare him after Absalom.

11:001:007 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with
           Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.

11:001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
           Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men
           which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.

11:001:009 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone
           of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren
           the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:

11:001:010 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and
           Solomon his brother, he called not.

11:001:011 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
           saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith
           doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?

11:001:012 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,
           that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son
           Solomon.

11:001:013 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst
           not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying,
           Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
           sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?

11:001:014 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also
           will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.

11:001:015 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
           king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto
           the king.

11:001:016 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
           king said, What wouldest thou?

11:001:017 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy
           God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son
           shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

11:001:018 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
           thou knowest it not:

11:001:019 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,
           and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the
           priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy
           servant hath he not called.

11:001:020 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon
           thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the
           throne of my lord the king after him.

11:001:021 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
           sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be
           counted offenders.

11:001:022 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
           prophet also came in.

11:001:023 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
           when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
           the king with his face to the ground.

11:001:024 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah
           shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

11:001:025 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat
           cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's
           sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest;
           and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save
           king Adonijah.

11:001:026 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
           the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
           called.

11:001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not
           shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my
           lord the king after him?

11:001:028 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she
           came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

11:001:029 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
           redeemed my soul out of all distress,

11:001:030 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying,
           Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
           sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do
           this day.

11:001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
           reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live
           for ever.

11:001:032 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
           prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before
           the king.

11:001:033 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of
           your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own
           mule, and bring him down to Gihon:

11:001:034 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
           there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say,
           God save king Solomon.

11:001:035 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon
           my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have
           appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

11:001:036 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
           Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.

11:001:037 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he
           with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of
           my lord king David.

11:001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the
           son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went
           down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and
           brought him to Gihon.

11:001:039 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the
           tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet;
           and all the people said, God save king Solomon.

11:001:040 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped
           with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth
           rent with the sound of them.

11:001:041 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
           they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound
           of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city
           being in an uproar?

11:001:042 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
           the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou
           art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

11:001:043 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord
           king David hath made Solomon king.

11:001:044 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan
           the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
           Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to
           ride upon the king's mule:

11:001:045 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
           king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so
           that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have
           heard.

11:001:046 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

11:001:047 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king
           David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy
           name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the
           king bowed himself upon the bed.

11:001:048 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of
           Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day,
           mine eyes even seeing it.

11:001:049 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and
           rose up, and went every man his way.

11:001:050 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,
           and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

11:001:051 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
           Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the
           altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he
           will not slay his servant with the sword.

11:001:052 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
           shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness
           shall be found in him, he shall die.

11:001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the
           altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and
           Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.

11:002:001 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he
           charged Solomon his son, saying,

11:002:002 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and
           shew thyself a man;

11:002:003 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways,
           to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
           and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses,
           that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and
           whithersoever thou turnest thyself:

11:002:004 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning
           me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk
           before me in truth with all their heart and with all their
           soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne
           of Israel.

11:002:005 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to
           me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of
           Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of
           Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
           put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins,
           and in his shoes that were on his feet.

11:002:006 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar
           head go down to the grave in peace.

11:002:007 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
           and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they
           came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.

11:002:008 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
           Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in
           the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me
           at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not
           put thee to death with the sword.

11:002:009 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man,
           and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar
           head bring thou down to the grave with blood.

11:002:010 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
           David.

11:002:011 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
           seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
           reigned he in Jerusalem.

11:002:012 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
           kingdom was established greatly.

11:002:013 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother
           of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
           Peaceably.

11:002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
           said, Say on.

11:002:015 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that
           all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit
           the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for
           it was his from the LORD.

11:002:016 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
           unto him, Say on.

11:002:017 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for
           he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the
           Shunammite to wife.

11:002:018 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.

11:002:019 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him
           for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed
           himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a
           seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right
           hand.

11:002:020 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray
           thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my
           mother: for I will not say thee nay.

11:002:021 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
           thy brother to wife.

11:002:022 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why
           dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him
           the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him,
           and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

11:002:023 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me,
           and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against
           his own life.

11:002:024 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me,
           and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made
           me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death
           this day.

11:002:025 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of
           Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.

11:002:026 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to
           Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death:
           but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou
           barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and
           because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was
           afflicted.

11:002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the
           LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he
           spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

11:002:028 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
           though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the
           tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the
           altar.

11:002:029 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
           tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then
           Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall
           upon him.

11:002:030 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
           him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I
           will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again,
           saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.

11:002:031 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
           him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent
           blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my
           father.

11:002:032 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who
           fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew
           them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to
           wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and
           Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.

11:002:033 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
           upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon
           his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there
           be peace for ever from the LORD.

11:002:034 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
           slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the
           wilderness.

11:002:035 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over
           the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of
           Abiathar.

11:002:036 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
           Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not
           forth thence any whither.

11:002:037 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest
           over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou
           shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

11:002:038 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord
           the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt
           in Jerusalem many days.

11:002:039 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
           servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of
           Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in
           Gath.

11:002:040 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
           Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his
           servants from Gath.

11:002:041 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
           Gath, and was come again.

11:002:042 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
           Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto
           thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out,
           and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die?
           and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.

11:002:043 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
           commandment that I have charged thee with?

11:002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the
           wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to
           David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy
           wickedness upon thine own head;

11:002:045 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
           shall be established before the LORD for ever.

11:002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
           out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was
           established in the hand of Solomon.

11:003:001 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
           Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
           until he had made an end of building his own house, and the
           house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

11:003:002 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was
           no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.

11:003:003 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David
           his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high
           places.

11:003:004 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
           the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
           offer upon that altar.

11:003:005 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:
           and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.

11:003:006 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
           father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in
           truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with
           thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that
           thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this
           day.

11:003:007 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king
           instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I
           know not how to go out or come in.

11:003:008 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
           chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
           for multitude.

11:003:009 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
           people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is
           able to judge this thy so great a people?

11:003:010 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this
           thing.

11:003:011 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
           hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked
           riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies;
           but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;

11:003:012 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given
           thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none
           like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like
           unto thee.

11:003:013 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,
           both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among
           the kings like unto thee all thy days.

11:003:014 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
           commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will
           lengthen thy days.

11:003:015 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
           Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace
           offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.

11:003:016 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king,
           and stood before him.

11:003:017 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in
           one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the
           house.

11:003:018 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
           that this woman was delivered also: and we were together;
           there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the
           house.

11:003:019 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid
           it.

11:003:020 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
           while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
           her dead child in my bosom.

11:003:021 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold,
           it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning,
           behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.

11:003:022 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and
           the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy
           son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the
           king.

11:003:023 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
           and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son
           is the dead, and my son is the living.

11:003:024 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
           before the king.

11:003:025 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
           half to the one, and half to the other.

11:003:026 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
           for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,
           give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the
           other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.

11:003:027 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
           and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.

11:003:028 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had
           judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom
           of God was in him, to do judgment.

11:004:001 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

11:004:002 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of
           Zadok the priest,

11:004:003 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat
           the son of Ahilud, the recorder.

11:004:004 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok
           and Abiathar were the priests:

11:004:005 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud
           the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's
           friend:

11:004:006 And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of
           Abda was over the tribute.

11:004:007 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which
           provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his
           month in a year made provision.

11:004:008 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:

11:004:009 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh,
           and Elonbethhanan:

11:004:010 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all
           the land of Hepher:

11:004:011 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had
           Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:

11:004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
           and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from
           Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond
           Jokneam:

11:004:013 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns
           of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also
           pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore
           great cities with walls and brasen bars:

11:004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:

11:004:015 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
           Solomon to wife:

11:004:016 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:

11:004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:

11:004:018 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:

11:004:019 Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the
           country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of
           Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.

11:004:020 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
           multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

11:004:021 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
           land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they
           brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

11:004:022 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of
           fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,

11:004:023 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an
           hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and
           fatted fowl.

11:004:024 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the
           river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this
           side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.

11:004:025 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine
           and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the
           days of Solomon.

11:004:026 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his
           chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

11:004:027 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for
           all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his
           month: they lacked nothing.

11:004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought
           they unto the place where the officers were, every man
           according to his charge.

11:004:029 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
           and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea
           shore.

11:004:030 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
           of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

11:004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
           Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame
           was in all nations round about.

11:004:032 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
           thousand and five.

11:004:033 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
           even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake
           also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
           fishes.

11:004:034 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
           from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

11:005:001 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he
           had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
           father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.

11:005:002 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

11:005:003 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house
           unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were
           about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the
           soles of his feet.

11:005:004 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so
           that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.

11:005:005 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the
           LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying,
           Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall
           build an house unto my name.

11:005:006 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
           Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto
           thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that
           thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among
           us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

11:005:007 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
           that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this
           day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great
           people.

11:005:008 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the
           things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy
           desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of
           fir.

11:005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea:
           and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that
           thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged
           there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish
           my desire, in giving food for my household.

11:005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to
           all his desire.

11:005:011 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
           food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus
           gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.

11:005:012 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
           there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
           league together.

11:005:013 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
           was thirty thousand men.

11:005:014 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses:
           a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and
           Adoniram was over the levy.

11:005:015 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
           and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;

11:005:016 Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the
           work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the
           people that wrought in the work.

11:005:017 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
           stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

11:005:018 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and
           the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build
           the house.

11:006:001 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year
           after the children of Israel were come out of the land of
           Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in
           the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to
           build the house of the LORD.

11:006:002 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the
           length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof
           twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.

11:006:003 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
           was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
           and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.

11:006:004 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.

11:006:005 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round
           about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the
           temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:

11:006:006 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle
           was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad:
           for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests
           round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the
           walls of the house.

11:006:007 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone
           made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was
           neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the
           house, while it was in building.

11:006:008 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
           house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
           chamber, and out of the middle into the third.

11:006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house
           with beams and boards of cedar.

11:006:010 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
           high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

11:006:011 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,

11:006:012 Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt
           walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my
           commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with
           thee, which I spake unto David thy father:

11:006:013 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
           forsake my people Israel.

11:006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

11:006:015 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of
           cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the
           ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and
           covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.

11:006:016 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
           floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them
           for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy
           place.

11:006:017 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
           long.

11:006:018 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and
           open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.

11:006:019 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there
           the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

11:006:020 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length,
           and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height
           thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the
           altar which was of cedar.

11:006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he
           made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and
           he overlaid it with gold.

11:006:022 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had
           finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the
           oracle he overlaid with gold.

11:006:023 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree,
           each ten cubits high.

11:006:024 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five
           cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part
           of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten
           cubits.

11:006:025 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were
           of one measure and one size.

11:006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of
           the other cherub.

11:006:027 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
           stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing
           of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
           cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one
           another in the midst of the house.

11:006:028 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

11:006:029 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with
           carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers,
           within and without.

11:006:030 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
           without.

11:006:031 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive
           tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

11:006:032 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
           carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and
           overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims,
           and upon the palm trees.

11:006:033 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive
           tree, a fourth part of the wall.

11:006:034 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
           door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were
           folding.

11:006:035 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open
           flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved
           work.

11:006:036 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,
           and a row of cedar beams.

11:006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
           laid, in the month Zif:

11:006:038 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the
           eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts
           thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he
           seven years in building it.

11:007:001 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
           finished all his house.

11:007:002 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length
           thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty
           cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows
           of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.

11:007:003 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay
           on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.

11:007:004 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against
           light in three ranks.

11:007:005 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and
           light was against light in three ranks.

11:007:006 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty
           cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch
           was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were
           before them.

11:007:007 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even
           the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one
           side of the floor to the other.

11:007:008 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the
           porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house
           for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto
           this porch.

11:007:009 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of
           hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from
           the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward
           the great court.

11:007:010 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
           stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

11:007:011 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed
           stones, and cedars.

11:007:012 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
           stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of
           the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.

11:007:013 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

11:007:014 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
           was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with
           wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in
           brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.

11:007:015 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high
           apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them
           about.

11:007:016 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the
           tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five
           cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:

11:007:017 And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the
           chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for
           the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.

11:007:018 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
           network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with
           pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.

11:007:019 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were
           of lily work in the porch, four cubits.

11:007:020 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
           above, over against the belly which was by the network: and
           the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the
           other chapiter.

11:007:021 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he
           set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin:
           and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof
           Boaz.

11:007:022 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work
           of the pillars finished.

11:007:023 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
           other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits:
           and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

11:007:024 And under the brim of it round about there were knops
           compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about:
           the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.

11:007:025 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
           three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
           south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
           above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

11:007:026 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
           wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it
           contained two thousand baths.

11:007:027 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of
           one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three
           cubits the height of it.

11:007:028 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had
           borders, and the borders were between the ledges:

11:007:029 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions,
           oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base
           above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions
           made of thin work.

11:007:030 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass:
           and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver
           were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.

11:007:031 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
           but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a
           cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings
           with their borders, foursquare, not round.

11:007:032 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of
           the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel
           was a cubit and half a cubit.

11:007:033 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot
           wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes,
           and their spokes, were all molten.

11:007:034 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one
           base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.

11:007:035 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
           cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and
           the borders thereof were of the same.

11:007:036 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders
           thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according
           to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.

11:007:037 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
           casting, one measure, and one size.

11:007:038 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty
           baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of
           the ten bases one laver.

11:007:039 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five
           on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right
           side of the house eastward over against the south.

11:007:040 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
           Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king
           Solomon for the house of the LORD:

11:007:041 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were
           on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover
           the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the
           pillars;

11:007:042 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two
           rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls
           of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;

11:007:043 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;

11:007:044 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;

11:007:045 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these
           vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the
           LORD, were of bright brass.

11:007:046 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
           ground between Succoth and Zarthan.

11:007:047 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
           exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.

11:007:048 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house
           of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold,
           whereupon the shewbread was,

11:007:049 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and
           five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the
           lamps, and the tongs of gold,

11:007:050 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the
           spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold,
           both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place,
           and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.

11:007:051 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house
           of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his
           father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the
           vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the
           LORD.

11:008:001 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
           of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
           Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring
           up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of
           David, which is Zion.

11:008:002 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king
           Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the
           seventh month.

11:008:003 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
           ark.

11:008:004 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of
           the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
           tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring
           up.

11:008:005 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that
           were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark,
           sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor
           numbered for multitude.

11:008:006 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy
           place, even under the wings of the cherubims.

11:008:007 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place
           of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
           thereof above.

11:008:008 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
           seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were
           not seen without: and there they are unto this day.

11:008:009 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone,
           which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant
           with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
           Egypt.

11:008:010 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
           holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,

11:008:011 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the
           cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the
           LORD.

11:008:012 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the
           thick darkness.

11:008:013 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
           for thee to abide in for ever.

11:008:014 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
           congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel
           stood;)

11:008:015 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake
           with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand
           fulfilled it, saying,

11:008:016 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of
           Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to
           build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose
           David to be over my people Israel.

11:008:017 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
           for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

11:008:018 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in
           thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well
           that it was in thine heart.

11:008:019 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
           shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house
           unto my name.

11:008:020 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
           risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne
           of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for
           the name of the LORD God of Israel.

11:008:021 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the
           covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he
           brought them out of the land of Egypt.

11:008:022 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence
           of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
           toward heaven:

11:008:023 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in
           heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and
           mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their
           heart:

11:008:024 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
           promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast
           fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

11:008:025 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David
           my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not
           fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so
           that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk
           before me as thou hast walked before me.

11:008:026 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be
           verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.

11:008:027 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
           heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this
           house that I have builded?

11:008:028 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to
           his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
           to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:

11:008:029 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
           even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall
           be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy
           servant shall make toward this place.

11:008:030 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of
           thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and
           hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest,
           forgive.

11:008:031 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
           upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine
           altar in this house:

11:008:032 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants,
           condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and
           justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
           righteousness.

11:008:033 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy,
           because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to
           thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication
           unto thee in this house:

11:008:034 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people
           Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest
           unto their fathers.

11:008:035 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
           have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and
           confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou
           afflictest them:

11:008:036 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants,
           and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way
           wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which
           thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.

11:008:037 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
           blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their
           enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever
           plague, whatsoever sickness there be;

11:008:038 What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by
           all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague
           of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this
           house:

11:008:039 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and
           do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart
           thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of
           all the children of men;)

11:008:040 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the
           land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

11:008:041 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people
           Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;

11:008:042 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong
           hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and
           pray toward this house;

11:008:043 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to
           all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of
           the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people
           Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have
           builded, is called by thy name.

11:008:044 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy,
           whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the
           LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the
           house that I have built for thy name:

11:008:045 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
           and maintain their cause.

11:008:046 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth
           not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the
           enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of
           the enemy, far or near;

11:008:047 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
           were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto
           thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying,
           We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed
           wickedness;

11:008:048 And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all
           their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away
           captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou
           gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen,
           and the house which I have built for thy name:

11:008:049 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven
           thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,

11:008:050 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all
           their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against
           thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them
           captive, that they may have compassion on them:

11:008:051 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
           broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace
           of iron:

11:008:052 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy
           servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to
           hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.

11:008:053 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
           earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of
           Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of
           Egypt, O LORD God.

11:008:054 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying
           all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from
           before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with
           his hands spread up to heaven.

11:008:055 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with
           a loud voice, saying,

11:008:056 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people
           Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not
           failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by
           the hand of Moses his servant.

11:008:057 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let
           him not leave us, nor forsake us:

11:008:058 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his
           ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his
           judgments, which he commanded our fathers.

11:008:059 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication
           before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night,
           that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of
           his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:

11:008:060 That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is
           God, and that there is none else.

11:008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
           walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this
           day.

11:008:062 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice
           before the LORD.

11:008:063 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
           offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an
           hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the
           children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.

11:008:064 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that
           was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
           offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace
           offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD
           was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat
           offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.

11:008:065 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with
           him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto
           the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and
           seven days, even fourteen days.

11:008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed
           the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart
           for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his
           servant, and for Israel his people.

11:009:001 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of
           the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's
           desire which he was pleased to do,

11:009:002 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
           appeared unto him at Gibeon.

11:009:003 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
           supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed
           this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for
           ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

11:009:004 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked,
           in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to
           all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and
           my judgments:

11:009:005 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel
           for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There
           shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.

11:009:006 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
           children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes
           which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and
           worship them:

11:009:007 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
           them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will
           I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a
           byword among all people:

11:009:008 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it
           shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why
           hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?

11:009:009 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their
           God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
           and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them,
           and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all
           this evil.

11:009:010 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon
           had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the
           king's house,

11:009:011 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
           trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his
           desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in
           the land of Galilee.

11:009:012 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon
           had given him; and they pleased him not.

11:009:013 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me,
           my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this
           day.

11:009:014 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

11:009:015 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised;
           for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and
           Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and
           Gezer.

11:009:016 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and
           burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the
           city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's
           wife.

11:009:017 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,

11:009:018 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,

11:009:019 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for
           his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which
           Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in
           all the land of his dominion.

11:009:020 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
           Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the
           children of Israel,

11:009:021 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the
           children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon
           those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

11:009:022 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but
           they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and
           his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.

11:009:023 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's
           work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people
           that wrought in the work.

11:009:024 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto
           her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build
           Millo.

11:009:025 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
           and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the
           LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the
           LORD. So he finished the house.

11:009:026 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
           beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of
           Edom.

11:009:027 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
           knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

11:009:028 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
           hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

11:010:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
           concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with
           hard questions.

11:010:002 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
           that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and
           when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all
           that was in her heart.

11:010:003 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any
           thing hid from the king, which he told her not.

11:010:004 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and
           the house that he had built,

11:010:005 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
           and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and
           his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the
           house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.

11:010:006 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
           mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.

11:010:007 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes
           had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom
           and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.

11:010:008 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
           continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.

11:010:009 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set
           thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel
           for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and
           justice.

11:010:010 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
           and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there
           came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen
           of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

11:010:011 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
           brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and
           precious stones.

11:010:012 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
           the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries
           for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen
           unto this day.

11:010:013 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
           whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of
           his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country,
           she and her servants.

11:010:014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
           six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,

11:010:015 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of
           the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of
           the governors of the country.

11:010:016 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
           hundred shekels of gold went to one target.

11:010:017 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound
           of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house
           of the forest of Lebanon.

11:010:018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
           it with the best gold.

11:010:019 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
           behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of
           the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.

11:010:020 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
           upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any
           kingdom.

11:010:021 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all
           the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure
           gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the
           days of Solomon.

11:010:022 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
           Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish,
           bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

11:010:023 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
           and for wisdom.

11:010:024 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
           God had put in his heart.

11:010:025 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
           vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses,
           and mules, a rate year by year.

11:010:026 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he
           had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
           horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and
           with the king at Jerusalem.

11:010:027 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and
           cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the
           vale, for abundance.

11:010:028 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
           the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

11:010:029 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
           shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and
           so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of
           Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

11:011:001 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
           daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,
           Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:

11:011:002 Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the
           children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall
           they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your
           heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.

11:011:003 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
           concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

11:011:004 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives
           turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not
           perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his
           father.

11:011:005 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
           and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

11:011:006 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not
           fully after the LORD, as did David his father.

11:011:007 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the
           abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and
           for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.

11:011:008 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
           incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

11:011:009 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was
           turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto
           him twice,

11:011:010 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should
           not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD
           commanded.

11:011:011 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is
           done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my
           statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the
           kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.

11:011:012 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
           father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

11:011:013 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give
           one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for
           Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.

11:011:014 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
           Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.

11:011:015 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
           captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he
           had smitten every male in Edom;

11:011:016 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until
           he had cut off every male in Edom:)

11:011:017 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's
           servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little
           child.

11:011:018 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took
           men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto
           Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed
           him victuals, and gave him land.

11:011:019 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
           he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of
           Tahpenes the queen.

11:011:020 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
           Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in
           Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.

11:011:021 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his
           fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad
           said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own
           country.

11:011:022 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
           that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he
           answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.

11:011:023 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
           Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:

11:011:024 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band,
           when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and
           dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.

11:011:025 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
           beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel,
           and reigned over Syria.

11:011:026 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
           Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow
           woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.

11:011:027 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
           king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the
           city of David his father.

11:011:028 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
           seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him
           ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.

11:011:029 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
           Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in
           the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they
           two were alone in the field:

11:011:030 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it
           in twelve pieces:

11:011:031 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith
           the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom
           out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:

11:011:032 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and
           for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all
           the tribes of Israel:)

11:011:033 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped
           Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the
           Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and
           have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine
           eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David
           his father.

11:011:034 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but
           I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my
           servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments
           and my statutes:

11:011:035 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
           give it unto thee, even ten tribes.

11:011:036 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
           may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which
           I have chosen me to put my name there.

11:011:037 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all
           that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.

11:011:038 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
           thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my
           sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my
           servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure
           house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.

11:011:039 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for
           ever.

11:011:040 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
           and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in
           Egypt until the death of Solomon.

11:011:041 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
           his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of
           Solomon?

11:011:042 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
           was forty years.

11:011:043 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
           of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
           stead.

11:012:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to
           Shechem to make him king.

11:012:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
           yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence
           of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)

11:012:003 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the
           congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,

11:012:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the
           grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he
           put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

11:012:005 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come
           again to me. And the people departed.

11:012:006 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood
           before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do
           ye advise that I may answer this people?

11:012:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant
           unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer
           them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy
           servants for ever.

11:012:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had
           given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up
           with him, and which stood before him:

11:012:009 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer
           this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
           which thy father did put upon us lighter?

11:012:010 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
           saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto
           thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
           lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little
           finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

11:012:011 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I
           will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with
           whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

11:012:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
           as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third
           day.

11:012:013 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
           men's counsel that they gave him;

11:012:014 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
           My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke:
           my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
           you with scorpions.

11:012:015 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the
           cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying,
           which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the
           son of Nebat.

11:012:016 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
           the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in
           David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to
           your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So
           Israel departed unto their tents.

11:012:017 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
           Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

11:012:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and
           all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore
           king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee
           to Jerusalem.

11:012:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

11:012:020 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
           come again, that they sent and called him unto the
           congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was
           none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah
           only.

11:012:021 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
           house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and
           fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight
           against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to
           Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

11:012:022 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

11:012:023 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and
           unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant
           of the people, saying,

11:012:024 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
           your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his
           house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to
           the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the
           word of the LORD.

11:012:025 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt
           therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.

11:012:026 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return
           to the house of David:

11:012:027 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD
           at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again
           unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they
           shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.

11:012:028 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
           and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to
           Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up
           out of the land of Egypt.

11:012:029 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.

11:012:030 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship
           before the one, even unto Dan.

11:012:031 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
           lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

11:012:032 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
           fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in
           Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel,
           sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in
           Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.

11:012:033 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
           fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he
           had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the
           children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt
           incense.

11:013:001 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
           of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to
           burn incense.

11:013:002 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and
           said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child
           shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and
           upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that
           burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon
           thee.

11:013:003 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign
           which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent,
           and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.

11:013:004 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of
           the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel,
           that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on
           him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
           so that he could not pull it in again to him.

11:013:005 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the
           altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by
           the word of the LORD.

11:013:006 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat
           now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my
           hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the
           LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became
           as it was before.

11:013:007 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
           refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

11:013:008 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me
           half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I
           eat bread nor drink water in this place:

11:013:009 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat
           no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that
           thou camest.

11:013:010 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he
           came to Bethel.

11:013:011 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came
           and told him all the works that the man of God had done that
           day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king,
           them they told also to their father.

11:013:012 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his
           sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from
           Judah.

11:013:013 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
           him the ass: and he rode thereon,

11:013:014 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an
           oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest
           from Judah? And he said, I am.

11:013:015 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

11:013:016 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
           neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this
           place:

11:013:017 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat
           no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the
           way that thou camest.

11:013:018 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an
           angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him
           back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and
           drink water. But he lied unto him.

11:013:019 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
           drank water.

11:013:020 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word
           of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:

11:013:021 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying,
           Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the
           mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the
           LORD thy God commanded thee,

11:013:022 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the
           place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread,
           and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the
           sepulchre of thy fathers.

11:013:023 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he
           had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the
           prophet whom he had brought back.

11:013:024 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
           and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it,
           the lion also stood by the carcase.

11:013:025 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the
           way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and
           told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.

11:013:026 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
           thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient
           unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered
           him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him,
           according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.

11:013:027 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
           saddled him.

11:013:028 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
           and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten
           the carcase, nor torn the ass.

11:013:029 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and
           laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet
           came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.

11:013:030 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned
           over him, saying, Alas, my brother!

11:013:031 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to
           his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the
           sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones
           beside his bones:

11:013:032 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against
           the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high
           places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come
           to pass.

11:013:033 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
           made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high
           places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one
           of the priests of the high places.

11:013:034 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
           cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

11:014:001 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

11:014:002 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and
           disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of
           Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the
           prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.

11:014:003 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
           honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of
           the child.

11:014:004 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
           came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his
           eyes were set by reason of his age.

11:014:005 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
           cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick:
           thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when
           she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another
           woman.

11:014:006 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
           came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of
           Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am
           sent to thee with heavy tidings.

11:014:007 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
           Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made
           thee prince over my people Israel,

11:014:008 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it
           thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept
           my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do
           that only which was right in mine eyes;

11:014:009 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou
           hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to
           provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:

11:014:010 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of
           Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth
           against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
           and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a
           man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.

11:014:011 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
           him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat:
           for the LORD hath spoken it.

11:014:012 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when
           thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.

11:014:013 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only
           of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is
           found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the
           house of Jeroboam.

11:014:014 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
           shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even
           now.

11:014:015 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
           water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land,
           which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond
           the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the
           LORD to anger.

11:014:016 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
           who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.

11:014:017 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
           and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child
           died;

11:014:018 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according
           to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his
           servant Ahijah the prophet.

11:014:019 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
           he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the
           chronicles of the kings of Israel.

11:014:020 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
           and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in
           his stead.

11:014:021 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
           forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
           seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did
           choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.
           And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

11:014:022 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
           him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed,
           above all that their fathers had done.

11:014:023 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves,
           on every high hill, and under every green tree.

11:014:024 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did
           according to all the abominations of the nations which the
           LORD cast out before the children of Israel.

11:014:025 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
           Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:

11:014:026 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and
           the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and
           he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

11:014:027 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
           committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which
           kept the door of the king's house.

11:014:028 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
           that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard
           chamber.

11:014:029 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

11:014:030 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their
           days.

11:014:031 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah
           an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

11:015:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
           reigned Abijam over Judah.

11:015:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was
           Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

11:015:003 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
           before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
           God, as the heart of David his father.

11:015:004 Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a
