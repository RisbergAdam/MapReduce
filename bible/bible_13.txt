           the angel.

38:003:004 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,
           saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him
           he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from
           thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.

38:003:005 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they
           set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.
           And the angel of the LORD stood by.

38:003:006 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,

38:003:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways,
           and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my
           house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee
           places to walk among these that stand by.

38:003:008 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that
           sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I
           will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.

38:003:009 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one
           stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving
           thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the
           iniquity of that land in one day.

38:003:010 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man
           his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.

38:004:001 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as
           a man that is wakened out of his sleep.

38:004:002 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked,
           and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top
           of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the
           seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:

38:004:003 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the
           bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.

38:004:004 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me,
           saying, What are these, my lord?

38:004:005 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me,
           Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.

38:004:006 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word
           of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
           power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.

38:004:007 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
           become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof
           with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.

38:004:008 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

38:004:009 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this
           house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know
           that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.

38:004:010 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall
           rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel
           with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to
           and fro through the whole earth.

38:004:011 Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive
           trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left
           side thereof?

38:004:012 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two
           olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the
           golden oil out of themselves?

38:004:013 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be?
           And I said, No, my lord.

38:004:014 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by
           the LORD of the whole earth.

38:005:001 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold
           a flying roll.

38:005:002 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a
           flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the
           breadth thereof ten cubits.

38:005:003 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over
           the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall
           be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that
           sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.

38:005:004 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall
           enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him
           that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the
           midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber
           thereof and the stones thereof.

38:005:005 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto
           me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth
           forth.

38:005:006 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that
           goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance
           through all the earth.

38:005:007 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is
           a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.

38:005:008 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst
           of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth
           thereof.

38:005:009 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
           came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they
           had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the
           ephah between the earth and the heaven.

38:005:010 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these
           bear the ephah?

38:005:011 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of
           Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her
           own base.

38:006:001 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and,
           behold, there came four chariots out from between two
           mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.

38:006:002 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second
           chariot black horses;

38:006:003 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth
           chariot grisled and bay horses.

38:006:004 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me,
           What are these, my lord?

38:006:005 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four
           spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before
           the LORD of all the earth.

38:006:006 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north
           country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go
           forth toward the south country.

38:006:007 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk
           to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk
           to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro
           through the earth.

38:006:008 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold,
           these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit
           in the north country.

38:006:009 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

38:006:010 Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and
           of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the
           same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of
           Zephaniah;

38:006:011 Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon
           the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;

38:006:012 And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts,
           saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall
           grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the
           LORD:

38:006:013 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear
           the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he
           shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace
           shall be between them both.

38:006:014 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to
           Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in
           the temple of the LORD.

38:006:015 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple
           of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath
           sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will
           diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.

38:007:001 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that
           the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of
           the ninth month, even in Chisleu;

38:007:002 When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and
           Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,

38:007:003 And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the
           LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in
           the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so
           many years?

38:007:004 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,

38:007:005 Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests,
           saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh
           month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me,
           even to me?

38:007:006 And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for
           yourselves, and drink for yourselves?

38:007:007 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the
           former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in
           prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men
           inhabited the south and the plain?

38:007:008 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,

38:007:009 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true
           judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his
           brother:

38:007:010 And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger,
           nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his
           brother in your heart.

38:007:011 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and
           stopped their ears, that they should not hear.

38:007:012 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they
           should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts
           hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came
           a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.

38:007:013 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would
           not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD
           of hosts:

38:007:014 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
           whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them,
           that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the
           pleasant land desolate.

38:008:001 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,

38:008:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with
           great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.

38:008:003 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell
           in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a
           city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy
           mountain.

38:008:004 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old
           women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with
           his staff in his hand for very age.

38:008:005 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
           playing in the streets thereof.

38:008:006 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes
           of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be
           marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.

38:008:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people
           from the east country, and from the west country;

38:008:008 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of
           Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
           God, in truth and in righteousness.

38:008:009 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye
           that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the
           prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the
           house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be
           built.

38:008:010 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire
           for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or
           came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one
           against his neighbour.

38:008:011 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in
           the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.

38:008:012 For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her
           fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens
           shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this
           people to possess all these things.

38:008:013 And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the
           heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save
           you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands
           be strong.

38:008:014 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,
           when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of
           hosts, and I repented not:

38:008:015 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto
           Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.

38:008:016 These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the
           truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and
           peace in your gates:

38:008:017 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
           neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things
           that I hate, saith the LORD.

38:008:018 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,

38:008:019 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month,
           and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and
           the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and
           gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and
           peace.

38:008:020 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that
           there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:

38:008:021 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying,
           Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the
           LORD of hosts: I will go also.

38:008:022 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the
           LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.

38:008:023 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to
           pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the
           nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a
           Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God
           is with you.

38:009:001 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and
           Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as
           of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.

38:009:002 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though
           it be very wise.

38:009:003 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up
           silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

38:009:004 Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her
           power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.

38:009:005 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and
           be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be
           ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon
           shall not be inhabited.

38:009:006 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the
           pride of the Philistines.

38:009:007 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his
           abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth,
           even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor
           in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

38:009:008 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army,
           because of him that passeth by, and because of him that
           returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more:
           for now have I seen with mine eyes.

38:009:009 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
           Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and
           having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a
           colt the foal of an ass.

38:009:010 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse
           from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he
           shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be
           from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of
           the earth.

38:009:011 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent
           forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.

38:009:012 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day
           do I declare that I will render double unto thee;

38:009:013 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim,
           and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece,
           and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.

38:009:014 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go
           forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the
           trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.

38:009:015 The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour,
           and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a
           noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls,
           and as the corners of the altar.

38:009:016 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the
           flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a
           crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.

38:009:017 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!
           corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the
           maids.

38:010:001 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
           LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,
           to every one grass in the field.

38:010:002 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a
           lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain:
           therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled,
           because there was no shepherd.

38:010:003 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished
           the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the
           house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the
           battle.

38:010:004 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of
           him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.

38:010:005 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their
           enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they
           shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on
           horses shall be confounded.

38:010:006 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the
           house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them;
           for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had
           not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear
           them.

38:010:007 And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their
           heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall
           see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.

38:010:008 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed
           them: and they shall increase as they have increased.

38:010:009 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember
           me in far countries; and they shall live with their children,
           and turn again.

38:010:010 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and
           gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the
           land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for
           them.

38:010:011 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall
           smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river
           shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down,
           and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.

38:010:012 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up
           and down in his name, saith the LORD.

38:011:001 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy
           cedars.

38:011:002 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty
           are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the
           vintage is come down.

38:011:003 There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their
           glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for
           the pride of Jordan is spoiled.

38:011:004 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;

38:011:005 Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty:
           and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am
           rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.

38:011:006 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the
           LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his
           neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they
           shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver
           them.

38:011:007 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of
           the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called
           Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.

38:011:008 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul
           lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.

38:011:009 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;
           and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the
           rest eat every one the flesh of another.

38:011:010 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I
           might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.

38:011:011 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock
           that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.

38:011:012 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and
           if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of
           silver.

38:011:013 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly
           price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty
           pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of
           the LORD.

38:011:014 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might
           break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

38:011:015 And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments
           of a foolish shepherd.

38:011:016 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall
           not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young
           one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth
           still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their
           claws in pieces.

38:011:017 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword
           shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall
           be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly
           darkened.

38:012:001 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD,
           which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation
           of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.

38:012:002 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
           people round about, when they shall be in the siege both
           against Judah and against Jerusalem.

38:012:003 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for
           all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in
           pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered
           together against it.

38:012:004 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with
           astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine
           eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of
           the people with blindness.

38:012:005 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The
           inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of
           hosts their God.

38:012:006 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth
           of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf;
           and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right
           hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again
           in her own place, even in Jerusalem.

38:012:007 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the
           glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants
           of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.

38:012:008 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of
           Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall
           be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the
           angel of the LORD before them.

38:012:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to
           destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

38:012:010 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
           inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of
           supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have
           pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his
           only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is
           in bitterness for his firstborn.

38:012:011 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as
           the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.

38:012:012 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of
           the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of
           the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

38:012:013 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart;
           the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

38:012:014 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their
           wives apart.

38:013:001 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
           David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for
           uncleanness.

38:013:002 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of
           hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the
           land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will
           cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the
           land.

38:013:003 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy,
           then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto
           him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name
           of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him
           shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.

38:013:004 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall
           be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied;
           neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:

38:013:005 But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man
           taught me to keep cattle from my youth.

38:013:006 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine
           hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in
           the house of my friends.

38:013:007 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that
           is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and
           the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon
           the little ones.

38:013:008 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the
           LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the
           third shall be left therein.

38:013:009 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will
           refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is
           tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I
           will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my
           God.

38:014:001 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be
           divided in the midst of thee.

38:014:002 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and
           the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women
           ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity,
           and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the
           city.

38:014:003 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations,
           as when he fought in the day of battle.

38:014:004 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,
           which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives
           shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward
           the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of
           the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it
           toward the south.

38:014:005 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the
           valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall
           flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days
           of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and
           all the saints with thee.

38:014:006 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall
           not be clear, nor dark:

38:014:007 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not
           day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening
           time it shall be light.

38:014:008 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out
           from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half
           of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall
           it be.

38:014:009 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day
           shall there be one LORD, and his name one.

38:014:010 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon
           south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited
           in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first
           gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel
           unto the king's winepresses.

38:014:011 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
           destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.

38:014:012 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all
           the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh
           shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their
           eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall
           consume away in their mouth.

38:014:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult
           from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold
           every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall
           rise up against the hand of his neighbour.

38:014:014 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all
           the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and
           silver, and apparel, in great abundance.

38:014:015 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
           camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in
           these tents, as this plague.

38:014:016 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all
           the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from
           year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to
           keep the feast of tabernacles.

38:014:017 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the
           families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the
           LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.

38:014:018 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have
           no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will
           smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of
           tabernacles.

38:014:019 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of
           all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

38:014:020 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,
           HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall
           be like the bowls before the altar.

38:014:021 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness
           unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come
           and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there
           shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of
           hosts.

Book 39        Malachi

39:001:001 The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.

39:001:002 I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast
           thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD:
           yet I loved Jacob,

39:001:003 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage
           waste for the dragons of the wilderness.

39:001:004 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return
           and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts,
           They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call
           them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom
           the LORD hath indignation for ever.

39:001:005 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be
           magnified from the border of Israel.

39:001:006 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then
           I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master,
           where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests,
           that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy
           name?

39:001:007 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein
           have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD
           is contemptible.

39:001:008 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and
           if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now
           unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy
           person? saith the LORD of hosts.

39:001:009 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto
           us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons?
           saith the LORD of hosts.

39:001:010 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for
           nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I
           have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will
           I accept an offering at your hand.

39:001:011 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
           same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every
           place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure
           offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith
           the LORD of hosts.

39:001:012 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD
           is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is
           contemptible.

39:001:013 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have
           snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that
           which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an
           offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.

39:001:014 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male,
           and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for
           I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is
           dreadful among the heathen.

39:002:001 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.

39:002:002 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to
           give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even
           send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I
           have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.

39:002:003 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your
           faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take
           you away with it.

39:002:004 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you,
           that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

39:002:005 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to
           him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before
           my name.

39:002:006 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found
           in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did
           turn many away from iniquity.

39:002:007 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should
           seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD
           of hosts.

39:002:008 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to
           stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
           saith the LORD of hosts.

39:002:009 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before
           all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but
           have been partial in the law.

39:002:010 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why
           do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by
           profaning the covenant of our fathers?

39:002:011 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is
           committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned
           the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the
           daughter of a strange god.

39:002:012 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and
           the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that
           offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.

39:002:013 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD
           with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that
           he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with
           good will at your hand.

39:002:014 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness
           between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast
           dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of
           thy covenant.

39:002:015 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
           And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore
           take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously
           against the wife of his youth.

39:002:016 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting
           away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the
           LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye
           deal not treacherously.

39:002:017 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein
           have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is
           good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or,
           Where is the God of judgment?

39:003:001 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way
           before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to
           his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye
           delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.

39:003:002 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
           when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like
           fullers' soap:

39:003:003 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he
           shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
           silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in
           righteousness.

39:003:004 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant
           unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.

39:003:005 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
           witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and
           against false swearers, and against those that oppress the
           hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that
           turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith
           the LORD of hosts.

39:003:006 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob
           are not consumed.

39:003:007 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
           ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will
           return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein
           shall we return?

39:003:008 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein
           have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

39:003:009 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this
           whole nation.

39:003:010 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
           meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD
           of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and
           pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough
           to receive it.

39:003:011 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall
           not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine
           cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of
           hosts.

39:003:012 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a
           delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.

39:003:013 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye
           say, What have we spoken so much against thee?

39:003:014 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it
           that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked
           mournfully before the LORD of hosts?

39:003:015 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work
           wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even
           delivered.

39:003:016 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and
           the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance
           was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that
           thought upon his name.

39:003:017 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day
           when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man
           spareth his own son that serveth him.

39:003:018 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and
           the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth
           him not.

39:004:001 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and
           all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be
           stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the
           LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
           branch.

39:004:002 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness
           arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and
           grow up as calves of the stall.

39:004:003 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes
           under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this,
           saith the LORD of hosts.

39:004:004 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded
           unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and
           judgments.

39:004:005 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
           of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:

39:004:006 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
           and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come
           and smite the earth with a curse.

Book 40        Matthew

40:001:001 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
           the son of Abraham.

40:001:002 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
           Judas and his brethren;

40:001:003 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
           Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

40:001:004 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
           Naasson begat Salmon;

40:001:005 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;
           and Obed begat Jesse;

40:001:006 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
           Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

40:001:007 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
           begat Asa;

40:001:008 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
           begat Ozias;

40:001:009 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
           begat Ezekias;

40:001:010 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
           begat Josias;

40:001:011 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time
           they were carried away to Babylon:

40:001:012 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
           Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

40:001:013 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
           Eliakim begat Azor;

40:001:014 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
           Eliud;

40:001:015 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
           Matthan begat Jacob;

40:001:016 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
           Jesus, who is called Christ.

40:001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
           generations; and from David until the carrying away into
           Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away
           into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

40:001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
           mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
           she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

40:001:019 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
           make her a publick example, was minded to put her away
           privily.

40:001:020 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
           LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
           David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
           which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

40:001:021 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
           JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

40:001:022 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
           spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

40:001:023 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
           son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
           interpreted is, God with us.

40:001:024 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
           Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

40:001:025 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:
           and he called his name JESUS.

40:002:001 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
           Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
           Jerusalem,

40:002:002 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
           seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

40:002:003 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
           and all Jerusalem with him.

40:002:004 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of
           the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should
           be born.

40:002:005 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
           written by the prophet,

40:002:006 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least
           among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a
           Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.

40:002:007 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired
           of them diligently what time the star appeared.

40:002:008 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search
           diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him,
           bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.

40:002:009 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the
           star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it
           came and stood over where the young child was.

40:002:010 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
           joy.

40:002:011 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young
           child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:
           and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto
           him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

40:002:012 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
           to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

40:002:013 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
           appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the
           young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou
           there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young
           child to destroy him.

40:002:014 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
           night, and departed into Egypt:

40:002:015 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
           fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
           Out of Egypt have I called my son.

40:002:016 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
           was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
           that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from
           two years old and under, according to the time which he had
           diligently enquired of the wise men.

40:002:017 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
           prophet, saying,

40:002:018 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and
           great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not
           be comforted, because they are not.

40:002:019 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
           appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

40:002:020 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go
           into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the
           young child's life.

40:002:021 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and
           came into the land of Israel.

40:002:022 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the
           room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:
           notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned
           aside into the parts of Galilee:

40:002:023 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might
           be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be
           called a Nazarene.

40:003:001 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
           wilderness of Judaea,

40:003:002 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

40:003:003 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
           saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
           the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

40:003:004 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a
           leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and
           wild honey.

40:003:005 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the
           region round about Jordan,

40:003:006 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.

40:003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
           his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who
           hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

40:003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

40:003:009 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
           father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones
           to raise up children unto Abraham.

40:003:010 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
           therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is
           hewn down, and cast into the fire.

40:003:011 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
           cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not
           worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and
           with fire:

40:003:012 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
           floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn
           up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

40:003:013 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
           baptized of him.

40:003:014 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of
           thee, and comest thou to me?

40:003:015 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for
           thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
           suffered him.

40:003:016 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of
           the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he
           saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting
           upon him:

40:003:017 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in
           whom I am well pleased.

40:004:001 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
           tempted of the devil.

40:004:002 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
           afterward an hungred.

40:004:003 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son
           of God, command that these stones be made bread.

40:004:004 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
           bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
           mouth of God.

40:004:005 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth
           him on a pinnacle of the temple,

40:004:006 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
           down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
           concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up,
           lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

40:004:007 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
           the Lord thy God.

40:004:008 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
           mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and
           the glory of them;

40:004:009 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
           wilt fall down and worship me.

40:004:010 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
           written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
           shalt thou serve.

40:004:011 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
           ministered unto him.

40:004:012 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
           departed into Galilee;

40:004:013 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
           upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

40:004:014 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
           prophet, saying,

40:004:015 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of
           the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

40:004:016 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them
           which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
           up.

40:004:017 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for
           the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

40:004:018 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
           Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into
           the sea: for they were fishers.

40:004:019 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers
           of men.

40:004:020 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.

40:004:021 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the
           son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee
           their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

40:004:022 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and
           followed him.

40:004:023 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
           synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
           healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among
           the people.

40:004:024 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto
           him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and
           torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and
           those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and
           he healed them.

40:004:025 And there followed him great multitudes of people from
           Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from
           Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

40:005:001 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and
           when he was set, his disciples came unto him:

40:005:002 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

40:005:003 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of
           heaven.

40:005:004 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

40:005:005 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

40:005:006 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
           righteousness: for they shall be filled.

40:005:007 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

40:005:008 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

40:005:009 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
           children of God.

40:005:010 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake:
           for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

40:005:011 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
           and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
           sake.

40:005:012 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
           heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
           you.

40:005:013 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
           savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
           for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot
           of men.

40:005:014 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
           cannot be hid.

40:005:015 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but
           on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the
           house.

40:005:016 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
           good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

40:005:017 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
           I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

40:005:018 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot
           or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
           fulfilled.

40:005:019 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least
           commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the
           least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and
           teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
           heaven.

40:005:020 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall
           exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
           shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

40:005:021 Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt
           not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
           judgment:

40:005:022 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
           without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and
           whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger
           of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be
           in danger of hell fire.

40:005:023 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
           rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;

40:005:024 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first
           be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
           gift.

40:005:025 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way
           with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the
           judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be
           cast into prison.

40:005:026 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out
           thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

40:005:027 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
           not commit adultery:

40:005:028 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
           after her hath committed adultery with her already in his
           heart.

40:005:029 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it
           from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
           members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
           cast into hell.

40:005:030 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it
           from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
           members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
           cast into hell.

40:005:031 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
           give her a writing of divorcement:

40:005:032 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife,
           saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit
           adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced
           committeth adultery.

40:005:033 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old
           time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto
           the Lord thine oaths:

40:005:034 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for
           it is God's throne:

40:005:035 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by
           Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

40:005:036 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not
           make one hair white or black.

40:005:037 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for
           whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

40:005:038 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
           tooth for a tooth:

40:005:039 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever
           shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
           also.

40:005:040 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
           coat, let him have thy cloak also.

40:005:041 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him
           twain.

40:005:042 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow
           of thee turn not thou away.

40:005:043 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
           neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

40:005:044 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
           you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
           despitefully use you, and persecute you;

40:005:045 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:
           for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
           sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

40:005:046 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do
           not even the publicans the same?

40:005:047 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than
           others? do not even the publicans so?

40:005:048 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
           heaven is perfect.

40:006:001 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of
           them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in
           heaven.

40:006:002 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
           before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
           streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto
           you, They have their reward.

40:006:003 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
           right hand doeth:

40:006:004 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth
           in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

40:006:005 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
           are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
           the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.
           Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

40:006:006 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
           thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in
           secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee
           openly.

40:006:007 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do:
           for they think that they shall be heard for their much
           speaking.

40:006:008 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth
           what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

40:006:009 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
           heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

40:006:010 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
           heaven.

40:006:011 Give us this day our daily bread.

40:006:012 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

40:006:013 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For
           thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
           Amen.

40:006:014 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
           will also forgive you:

40:006:015 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
           Father forgive your trespasses.

40:006:016 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
           countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may
           appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have
           their reward.

40:006:017 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
           face;

40:006:018 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
           which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret,
           shall reward thee openly.

40:006:019 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
           rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

40:006:020 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
           moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break
           through nor steal:

40:006:021 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

40:006:022 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
           single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

40:006:023 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
           darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness,
           how great is that darkness!

40:006:024 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
           and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
           despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

40:006:025 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what
           ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
           what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
           body than raiment?

40:006:026 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they
           reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
           them. Are ye not much better than they?

40:006:027 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
           stature?

40:006:028 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
           the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

40:006:029 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was
           not arrayed like one of these.

40:006:030 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to
           day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
           more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

40:006:031 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What
           shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

40:006:032 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
           heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

40:006:033 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
           and all these things shall be added unto you.

40:006:034 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
           take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
           is the evil thereof.

40:007:001 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

40:007:002 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with
           what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

40:007:003 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
           but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

40:007:004 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote
           out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

40:007:005 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;
           and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of
           thy brother's eye.

40:007:006 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye
           your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their
           feet, and turn again and rend you.

40:007:007 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
           knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

40:007:008 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
           findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

40:007:009 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will
           he give him a stone?

40:007:010 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

40:007:011 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
           children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven
           give good things to them that ask him?

40:007:012 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to
           you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
           prophets.

40:007:013 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and
           broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there
           be which go in thereat:

40:007:014 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
           leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

40:007:015 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
           clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

40:007:016 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
           thorns, or figs of thistles?

40:007:017 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a
           corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

40:007:018 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
           corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

40:007:019 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
           and cast into the fire.

40:007:020 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

40:007:021 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
           the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
           which is in heaven.

40:007:022 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
           prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils?
           and in thy name done many wonderful works?

40:007:023 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart
           from me, ye that work iniquity.

40:007:024 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
           them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house
           upon a rock:

40:007:025 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
           blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was
           founded upon a rock.

40:007:026 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
           them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his
           house upon the sand:

40:007:027 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
           blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the
           fall of it.

40:007:028 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
           people were astonished at his doctrine:

40:007:029 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the
           scribes.

40:008:001 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
           followed him.

40:008:002 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying,
           Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

40:008:003 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will;
           be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

40:008:004 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy
           way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
           commanded, for a testimony unto them.

40:008:005 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him
           a centurion, beseeching him,

40:008:006 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
           grievously tormented.

40:008:007 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

40:008:008 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that
           thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only,
           and my servant shall be healed.

40:008:009 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and
           I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
           he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

40:008:010 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
           followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great
           faith, no, not in Israel.

40:008:011 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and
           west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
           in the kingdom of heaven.

40:008:012 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
           darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

40:008:013 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou
           hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was
           healed in the selfsame hour.

40:008:014 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's
           mother laid, and sick of a fever.

40:008:015 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she
           arose, and ministered unto them.

40:008:016 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
           possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his
           word, and healed all that were sick:

40:008:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
           prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our
           sicknesses.

40:008:018 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
           commandment to depart unto the other side.

40:008:019 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
           follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

40:008:020 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds
           of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to
           lay his head.

40:008:021 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me
           first to go and bury my father.

40:008:022 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury
           their dead.

40:008:023 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed
           him.

40:008:024 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
           that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

40:008:025 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord,
           save us: we perish.

40:008:026 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
           faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
           there was a great calm.

40:008:027 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this,
           that even the winds and the sea obey him!

40:008:028 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the
           Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming
           out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass
           by that way.

40:008:029 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
           thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment
           us before the time?

40:008:030 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine
           feeding.

40:008:031 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out,
           suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.

40:008:032 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they
           went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of
           swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
           perished in the waters.

40:008:033 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the
           city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the
           possessed of the devils.

40:008:034 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when
           they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of
           their coasts.

40:009:001 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his
           own city.

40:009:002 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy,
           lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the
           sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven
           thee.

40:009:003 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,
           This man blasphemeth.

40:009:004 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil
           in your hearts?

40:009:005 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or
           to say, Arise, and walk?

40:009:006 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
           to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,)
           Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.

40:009:007 And he arose, and departed to his house.

40:009:008 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified
           God, which had given such power unto men.

40:009:009 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
           Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto
           him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

40:009:010 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house,
           behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him
           and his disciples.

40:009:011 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples,
           Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?

40:009:012 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be
           whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.

40:009:013 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and
           not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but
           sinners to repentance.

40:009:014 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and
           the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?

40:009:015 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
           mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days
           will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and
           then shall they fast.

40:009:016 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for
           that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment,
           and the rent is made worse.

40:009:017 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
           break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but
           they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

40:009:018 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
           certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even
           now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall
           live.

40:009:019 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

40:009:020 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of
           blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of
           his garment:

40:009:021 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
           shall be whole.

40:009:022 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
           Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.
           And the woman was made whole from that hour.

40:009:023 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the
           minstrels and the people making a noise,

40:009:024 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
           sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

40:009:025 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her
           by the hand, and the maid arose.

40:009:026 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

40:009:027 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
           crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.

40:009:028 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to
           him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to
           do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.

40:009:029 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be
           it unto you.

40:009:030 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
           saying, See that no man know it.

40:009:031 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in
           all that country.

40:009:032 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
           possessed with a devil.

40:009:033 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the
           multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

40:009:034 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the
           prince of the devils.

40:009:035 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
           their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
           healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

40:009:036 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
           on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as
           sheep having no shepherd.

40:009:037 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is
           plenteous, but the labourers are few;

40:009:038 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send
           forth labourers into his harvest.

40:010:001 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
           them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to
           heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

40:010:002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first,
           Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the
           son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

40:010:003 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican;
           James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was
           Thaddaeus;

40:010:004 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
           him.

40:010:005 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go
           not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the
           Samaritans enter ye not:

40:010:006 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

40:010:007 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
           hand.

40:010:008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
           devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

40:010:009 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

40:010:010 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes,
           nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

40:010:011 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who
           in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

40:010:012 And when ye come into an house, salute it.

40:010:013 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but
           if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

40:010:014 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
           ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of
           your feet.

40:010:015 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land
           of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that
           city.

40:010:016 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be
           ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

40:010:017 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the
           councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

40:010:018 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my
           sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

40:010:019 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
           shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what
           ye shall speak.

40:010:020 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
           which speaketh in you.

40:010:021 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the
           father the child: and the children shall rise up against their
           parents, and cause them to be put to death.

40:010:022 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
           that endureth to the end shall be saved.

40:010:023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
           another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone
           over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

40:010:024 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above
           his lord.

40:010:025 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and
           the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the
           house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his
           household?

40:010:026 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that
           shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

40:010:027 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what
           ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

40:010:028 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
           kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy
           both soul and body in hell.

40:010:029 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them
           shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

40:010:030 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

40:010:031 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many
           sparrows.

40:010:032 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
           confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

40:010:033 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
           before my Father which is in heaven.

40:010:034 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
           send peace, but a sword.

40:010:035 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
           the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law
           against her mother in law.

40:010:036 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

40:010:037 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
           me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
           worthy of me.

40:010:038 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is
           not worthy of me.

40:010:039 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his
           life for my sake shall find it.

40:010:040 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
           receiveth him that sent me.

40:010:041 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
           receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous
           man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous
           man's reward.

40:010:042 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
           ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple,
           verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

40:011:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding
           his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to
           preach in their cities.

40:011:002 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
           sent two of his disciples,

40:011:003 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look
           for another?

40:011:004 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again
           those things which ye do hear and see:

40:011:005 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
           are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and
           the poor have the gospel preached to them.

40:011:006 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

40:011:007 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
           concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
           A reed shaken with the wind?

40:011:008 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
           raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings'
           houses.

40:011:009 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto
           you, and more than a prophet.

40:011:010 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
           messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before
           thee.

40:011:011 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
           hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
           notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is
           greater than he.

40:011:012 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
           heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

40:011:013 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

40:011:014 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to
           come.

40:011:015 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

40:011:016 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
           children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their
           fellows,

40:011:017 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we
           have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

40:011:018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He
           hath a devil.

40:011:019 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold
           a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
           sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.

40:011:020 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
           works were done, because they repented not:

40:011:021 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
           mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre
           and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
           ashes.

40:011:022 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
           Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

40:011:023 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
           brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been
           done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained
           until this day.

40:011:024 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the
           land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

40:011:025 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
           Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
           from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

40:011:026 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.

40:011:027 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
           knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
           Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
           him.

40:011:028 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
           will give you rest.

40:011:029 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
           lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

40:011:030 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

40:012:001 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn;
           and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears
           of corn and to eat.

40:012:002 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
           disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath
           day.

40:012:003 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when
           he was an hungred, and they that were with him;

40:012:004 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the
           shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for
           them which were with him, but only for the priests?

40:012:005 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days
           the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are
           blameless?

40:012:006 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
           temple.

40:012:007 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and
           not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

40:012:008 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.

40:012:009 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:

40:012:010 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
           they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
           days? that they might accuse him.

40:012:011 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
           shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
           day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

40:012:012 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
           lawful to do well on the sabbath days.

40:012:013 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
           stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the
           other.

40:012:014 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him,
           how they might destroy him.

40:012:015 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
           great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;

40:012:016 And charged them that they should not make him known:

40:012:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
           prophet, saying,

40:012:018 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my
           soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he
           shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.

40:012:019 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
           voice in the streets.

40:012:020 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he
           not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

40:012:021 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

40:012:022 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind,
           and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb
           both spake and saw.

40:012:023 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son
           of David?

40:012:024 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth
           not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the
           devils.

40:012:025 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every
           kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
           every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

40:012:026 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself;
           how shall then his kingdom stand?

40:012:027 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your
           children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

40:012:028 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the
           kingdom of God is come unto you.

40:012:029 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil
           his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he
           will spoil his house.

40:012:030 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth
           not with me scattereth abroad.

40:012:031 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy
           shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy
           Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

40:012:032 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
           be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy
           Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
           neither in the world to come.

40:012:033 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make
           the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known
           by his fruit.

40:012:034 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
           things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
           speaketh.

40:012:035 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth
           forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure
           bringeth forth evil things.

40:012:036 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
           they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

40:012:037 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
           thou shalt be condemned.

40:012:038 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
           saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.

40:012:039 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
           generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be
           given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:

40:012:040 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
           belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights
           in the heart of the earth.

40:012:041 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
           generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the
           preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

40:012:042 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
           generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
           uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
           and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

40:012:043 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
           through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

40:012:044 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
           out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and
           garnished.

40:012:045 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
           more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:
           and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even
           so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.

40:012:046 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
           brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.

40:012:047 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
           stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

40:012:048 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
           mother? and who are my brethren?

40:012:049 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and
           said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

40:012:050 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in
           heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

40:013:001 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
           side.

40:013:002 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that
           he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on
           the shore.

40:013:003 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,
           Behold, a sower went forth to sow;

40:013:004 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the
           fowls came and devoured them up:

40:013:005 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:
           and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of
           earth:

40:013:006 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they
           had no root, they withered away.

40:013:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and
           choked them:

40:013:008 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some
           an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

40:013:009 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

40:013:010 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
           unto them in parables?

40:013:011 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you
           to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
           is not given.

40:013:012 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
           more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be
           taken away even that he hath.

40:013:013 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
           not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

40:013:014 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith,
           By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing
           ye shall see, and shall not perceive:

40:013:015 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are
           dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any
           time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
           and should understand with their heart, and should be
           converted, and I should heal them.

40:013:016 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for
           they hear.

40:013:017 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous
           men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
           not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and
           have not heard them.

40:013:018 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

40:013:019 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and
           understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth
           away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which
           received seed by the way side.

40:013:020 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is
           he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;

40:013:021 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for
           when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word,
           by and by he is offended.

40:013:022 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
           the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of
           riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

40:013:023 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
           heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth
           fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty,
           some thirty.

40:013:024 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
           heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his
           field:

40:013:025 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the
           wheat, and went his way.

40:013:026 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit,
           then appeared the tares also.

40:013:027 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him,
           Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence
           then hath it tares?

40:013:028 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said
           unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

40:013:029 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root
           up also the wheat with them.

40:013:030 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
           harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first
           the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather
           the wheat into my barn.

40:013:031 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
           heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,
           and sowed in his field:

40:013:032 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown,
           it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that
           the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.

40:013:033 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
           like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three
           measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

40:013:034 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;
           and without a parable spake he not unto them:

40:013:035 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
           saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things
           which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

40:013:036 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house:
           and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the
           parable of the tares of the field.

40:013:037 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed
           is the Son of man;

40:013:038 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
           kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

40:013:039 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end
           of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

40:013:040 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
           shall it be in the end of this world.

40:013:041 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
           gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them
           which do iniquity;

40:013:042 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
           wailing and gnashing of teeth.

40:013:043 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
           of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

40:013:044 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
           field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy
           thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
           field.

40:013:045 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
           seeking goodly pearls:

40:013:046 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold
           all that he had, and bought it.

40:013:047 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
           into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

40:013:048 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and
           gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

40:013:049 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
           forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

40:013:050 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be
           wailing and gnashing of teeth.

40:013:051 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
           They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

40:013:052 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
           instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that
           is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure
           things new and old.

40:013:053 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
           parables, he departed thence.

40:013:054 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
           their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said,
           Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

40:013:055 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called
           Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and
           Judas?

40:013:056 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath
           this man all these things?

40:013:057 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
           prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in
           his own house.

40:013:058 And he did not many mighty works there because of their
           unbelief.

40:014:001 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

40:014:002 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is
           risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth
           themselves in him.

40:014:003 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
           prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.

40:014:004 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

40:014:005 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the
           multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.

40:014:006 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
           danced before them, and pleased Herod.

40:014:007 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
           would ask.

40:014:008 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
           here John Baptist's head in a charger.

40:014:009 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
           them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given
           her.

40:014:010 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

40:014:011 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the
           damsel: and she brought it to her mother.

40:014:012 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it,
           and went and told Jesus.

40:014:013 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a
           desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof,
           they followed him on foot out of the cities.

40:014:014 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved
           with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.

40:014:015 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,
           This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the
           multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
           themselves victuals.

40:014:016 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them
           to eat.

40:014:017 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
           fishes.

40:014:018 He said, Bring them hither to me.

40:014:019 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
           took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to
           heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his
           disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

40:014:020 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
           fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

40:014:021 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
           women and children.

40:014:022 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
           ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent
           the multitudes away.

40:014:023 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
           mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was
           there alone.

40:014:024 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with
           waves: for the wind was contrary.

40:014:025 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
           walking on the sea.

40:014:026 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
           troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

40:014:027 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good
           cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

40:014:028 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
           come unto thee on the water.

40:014:029 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the
           ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

40:014:030 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
           beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.

40:014:031 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught
           him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
           didst thou doubt?

40:014:032 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

40:014:033 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him,
           saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

40:014:034 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
           Gennesaret.

40:014:035 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent
           out into all that country round about, and brought unto him
           all that were diseased;

40:014:036 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his
           garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

40:015:001 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
           Jerusalem, saying,

40:015:002 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
           for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

40:015:003 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
           the commandment of God by your tradition?

40:015:004 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
           He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

40:015:005 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
           It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

40:015:006 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
           Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by
           your tradition.

40:015:007 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

40:015:008 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
           honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

40:015:009 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
           commandments of men.

40:015:010 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
           understand:

40:015:011 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
           which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

40:015:012 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
           the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

40:015:013 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly
           Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

40:015:014 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
           blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

40:015:015 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
           parable.

40:015:016 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

40:015:017 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
           mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

40:015:018 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
           from the heart; and they defile the man.

40:015:019 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,
           adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

40:015:020 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with
           unwashen hands defileth not a man.

40:015:021 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre
           and Sidon.

40:015:022 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
           and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son
           of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

40:015:023 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
           besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

40:015:024 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost
           sheep of the house of Israel.

40:015:025 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

40:015:026 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
           children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.

40:015:027 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
           which fall from their masters' table.

40:015:028 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
           faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was
           made whole from that very hour.

40:015:029 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
           Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

40:015:030 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those
           that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast
           them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:

40:015:031 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb
           to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the
           blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.

40:015:032 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
           compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
           three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them
           away fasting, lest they faint in the way.

40:015:033 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
           bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

40:015:034 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they
           said, Seven, and a few little fishes.

40:015:035 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

40:015:036 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
           and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples
           to the multitude.

40:015:037 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
           broken meat that was left seven baskets full.

40:015:038 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
           children.

40:015:039 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into
           the coasts of Magdala.

40:016:001 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting
           desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.

40:016:002 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
           will be fair weather: for the sky is red.

40:016:003 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the
           sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the
           face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the
           times?

40:016:004 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
           there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the
           prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.

40:016:005 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
           forgotten to take bread.

40:016:006 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven
           of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

40:016:007 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
           have taken no bread.

40:016:008 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
           faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought
           no bread?

40:016:009 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of
           the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

40:016:010 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
           baskets ye took up?

40:016:011 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you
           concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the
           Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

40:016:012 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the
           leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of
           the Sadducees.

40:016:013 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
           his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man
           am?

40:016:014 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
           Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

40:016:015 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?

40:016:016 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
           Son of the living God.

40:016:017 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
           Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
           but my Father which is in heaven.

40:016:018 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
           rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
           prevail against it.

40:016:019 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:
           and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
           heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
           loosed in heaven.

40:016:020 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man
           that he was Jesus the Christ.

40:016:021 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples,
           how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of
           the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and
           be raised again the third day.

40:016:022 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it
           far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

40:016:023 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
           thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things
           that be of God, but those that be of men.

40:016:024 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
           me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
           me.

40:016:025 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
           will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

40:016:026 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
           and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange
           for his soul?

40:016:027 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
           his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to
           his works.

40:016:028 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which
           shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming
           in his kingdom.

40:017:001 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
           brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,

40:017:002 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as
           the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.

40:017:003 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
           with him.

40:017:004 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for
           us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three
           tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
           Elias.

40:017:005 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:
           and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my
           beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

40:017:006 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
           were sore afraid.

40:017:007 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
           afraid.

40:017:008 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
           Jesus only.

40:017:009 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
           saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be
           risen again from the dead.

40:017:010 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes
           that Elias must first come?

40:017:011 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first
           come, and restore all things.

40:017:012 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
           him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.
           Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.

40:017:013 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
           the Baptist.

40:017:014 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
           certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,

40:017:015 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore
           vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the
           water.

40:017:016 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure
           him.

40:017:017 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
           generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I
           suffer you? bring him hither to me.

40:017:018 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and
           the child was cured from that very hour.

40:017:019 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could
           not we cast him out?

40:017:020 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily
           I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
           ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place;
           and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

40:017:021 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

40:017:022 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
           of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

40:017:023 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised
           again. And they were exceeding sorry.

40:017:024 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received
           tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master
           pay tribute?

40:017:025 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
           prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do
           the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own
           children, or of strangers?

40:017:026 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then
           are the children free.

40:017:027 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the
           sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh
           up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a
           piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

40:018:001 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
           the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

40:018:002 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
           midst of them,

40:018:003 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and
           become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
           of heaven.

40:018:004 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
           the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

40:018:005 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
           receiveth me.

40:018:006 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
           in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
           about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the
           sea.

40:018:007 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
           that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence
           cometh!

40:018:008 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
           and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
           life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet
           to be cast into everlasting fire.

40:018:009 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
           thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
           rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

40:018:010 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I
           say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the
           face of my Father which is in heaven.

40:018:011 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

40:018:012 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them
           be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and
           goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone
           astray?

40:018:013 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he
           rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine
           which went not astray.

40:018:014 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
           that one of these little ones should perish.

40:018:015 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
           tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall
           hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

40:018:016 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
           more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
           may be established.

40:018:017 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
           but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
           an heathen man and a publican.

40:018:018 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
           be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth
           shall be loosed in heaven.

40:018:019 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth
           as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done
           for them of my Father which is in heaven.

40:018:020 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
           am I in the midst of them.

40:018:021 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my
           brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?

40:018:022 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:
           but, Until seventy times seven.

40:018:023 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain
           king, which would take account of his servants.

40:018:024 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him,
           which owed him ten thousand talents.

40:018:025 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to
           be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and
           payment to be made.

40:018:026 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
           Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

40:018:027 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
           loosed him, and forgave him the debt.

40:018:028 But the same servant went out, and found one of his
           fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid
           hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that
           thou owest.

40:018:029 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
           saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

40:018:030 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
           should pay the debt.

40:018:031 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
           sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.

40:018:032 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O
           thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because
           thou desiredst me:

40:018:033 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
           fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?

40:018:034 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,
           till he should pay all that was due unto him.

40:018:035 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
           from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
           trespasses.

40:019:001 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
           sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of
           Judaea beyond Jordan;

40:019:002 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

40:019:003 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying
           unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for
           every cause?

40:019:004 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
           which made them at the beginning made them male and female,

40:019:005 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
           and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one
           flesh?

40:019:006 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What
           therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

40:019:007 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a
           writing of divorcement, and to put her away?

40:019:008 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your
           hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the
           beginning it was not so.

40:019:009 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
           it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
           adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit
           adultery.

40:019:010 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
           his wife, it is not good to marry.

40:019:011 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,
           save they to whom it is given.

40:019:012 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
           mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made
           eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made
           themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that
           is able to receive it, let him receive it.

40:019:013 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he
           should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples
           rebuked them.

40:019:014 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not,
           to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

40:019:015 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

40:019:016 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what
           good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

40:019:017 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
           good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,
           keep the commandments.

40:019:018 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
           Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou
           shalt not bear false witness,

40:019:019 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy
           neighbour as thyself.

40:019:020 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept
           from my youth up: what lack I yet?

40:019:021 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that
           thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
           in heaven: and come and follow me.

40:019:022 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
           sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

40:019:023 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,
           That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

40:019:024 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go
           through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
           the kingdom of God.

40:019:025 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
           saying, Who then can be saved?

40:019:026 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is
           impossible; but with God all things are possible.

40:019:027 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have
           forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?

40:019:028 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which
           have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man
           shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
           twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

40:019:029 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
           sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
           for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall
           inherit everlasting life.

40:019:030 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
           first.

40:020:001 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
           householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
           labourers into his vineyard.

40:020:002 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,
           he sent them into his vineyard.

40:020:003 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
           idle in the marketplace,

40:020:004 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and
           whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.

40:020:005 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
           likewise.

40:020:006 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
           standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the
           day idle?

40:020:007 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto
           them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,
           that shall ye receive.

40:020:008 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
           steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire,
           beginning from the last unto the first.

40:020:009 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour,
           they received every man a penny.

40:020:010 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
           received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

40:020:011 And when they had received it, they murmured against the
           goodman of the house,

40:020:012 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast
           made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat
           of the day.

40:020:013 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
           wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?

40:020:014 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this
           last, even as unto thee.

40:020:015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
           thine eye evil, because I am good?

40:020:016 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be
           called, but few chosen.

40:020:017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples
           apart in the way, and said unto them,

40:020:018 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
           betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they
           shall condemn him to death,

40:020:019 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge,
           and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.

40:020:020 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her
           sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.

40:020:021 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him,
           Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right
           hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.

40:020:022 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
           able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be
           baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say
           unto him, We are able.

40:020:023 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and
           be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to
           sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but
           it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my
           Father.

40:020:024 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
           against the two brethren.

40:020:025 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
           princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
           that are great exercise authority upon them.

40:020:026 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
           among you, let him be your minister;

40:020:027 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
           servant:

40:020:028 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
           minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

40:020:029 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed
           him.

40:020:030 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
           heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on
           us, O Lord, thou son of David.

40:020:031 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
           peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O
           Lord, thou son of David.

40:020:032 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
           that I shall do unto you?

40:020:033 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

40:020:034 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
           immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

40:021:001 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
           Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two
           disciples,

40:021:002 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
           straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her:
           loose them, and bring them unto me.

40:021:003 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
           need of them; and straightway he will send them.

40:021:004 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
           by the prophet, saying,

40:021:005 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
           thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
           ass.

40:021:006 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

40:021:007 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their
           clothes, and they set him thereon.

40:021:008 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
           others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in
           the way.

40:021:009 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
           saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh
           in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

40:021:010 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
           saying, Who is this?

40:021:011 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth
           of Galilee.

40:021:012 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
           that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables
           of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,

40:021:013 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called
           the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

40:021:014 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
           healed them.

40:021:015 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful
           things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
           saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore
           displeased,

40:021:016 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
           saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of
           babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

40:021:017 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and
           he lodged there.

40:021:018 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

40:021:019 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
           found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let
           no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the
           fig tree withered away.

40:021:020 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How
           soon is the fig tree withered away!

40:021:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If
           ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which
           is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this
           mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it
           shall be done.

40:021:022 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
           ye shall receive.

40:021:023 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and
           the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and
           said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave
           thee this authority?

40:021:024 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one
           thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by
           what authority I do these things.

40:021:025 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?
           And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
           From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe
           him?

40:021:026 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold
           John as a prophet.

40:021:027 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
           unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
           things.

40:021:028 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
           the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

40:021:029 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,
           and went.

40:021:030 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
           and said, I go, sir: and went not.

40:021:031 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say
           unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto
           you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of
           God before you.

40:021:032 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
           believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed
           him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that
           ye might believe him.

40:021:033 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
           planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a
           winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to
           husbandmen, and went into a far country:

40:021:034 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
           to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.

40:021:035 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
           another, and stoned another.

40:021:036 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they
           did unto them likewise.

40:021:037 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
           reverence my son.

40:021:038 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
           themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let
           us seize on his inheritance.

40:021:039 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and
           slew him.

40:021:040 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he
           do unto those husbandmen?

40:021:041 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men,
           and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
           shall render him the fruits in their seasons.

40:021:042 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
           The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
           head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is
           marvellous in our eyes?

40:021:043 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
           from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
           thereof.

40:021:044 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
           whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

40:021:045 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his
           parables, they perceived that he spake of them.

40:021:046 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
           multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

40:022:001 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
           said,

40:022:002 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made
           a marriage for his son,

40:022:003 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to
           the wedding: and they would not come.

40:022:004 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which
           are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my
           fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the
           marriage.

40:022:005 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his
           farm, another to his merchandise:

40:022:006 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them
           spitefully, and slew them.

40:022:007 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent
           forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up
           their city.

40:022:008 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
           which were bidden were not worthy.

40:022:009 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall
           find, bid to the marriage.

40:022:010 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
           together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the
           wedding was furnished with guests.

40:022:011 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a
           man which had not on a wedding garment:

40:022:012 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not
           having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

40:022:013 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,
           and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there
           shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

40:022:014 For many are called, but few are chosen.

40:022:015 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
           entangle him in his talk.

40:022:016 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
           saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the
           way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou
           regardest not the person of men.

40:022:017 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
           tribute unto Caesar, or not?

40:022:018 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye
           me, ye hypocrites?

40:022:019 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

40:022:020 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
           superscription?

40:022:021 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render
           therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto
           God the things that are God's.

40:022:022 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
           and went their way.

40:022:023 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there
           is no resurrection, and asked him,

40:022:024 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children,
           his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his
           brother.

40:022:025 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
           had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his
           wife unto his brother:

40:022:026 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

40:022:027 And last of all the woman died also.

40:022:028 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
           seven? for they all had her.

40:022:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
           scriptures, nor the power of God.

40:022:030 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
           marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

40:022:031 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
           that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

40:022:032 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
           Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

40:022:033 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
           doctrine.

40:022:034 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
           to silence, they were gathered together.

40:022:035 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
           tempting him, and saying,

40:022:036 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

40:022:037 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
           thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

40:022:038 This is the first and great commandment.

40:022:039 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
           as thyself.

40:022:040 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

40:022:041 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

40:022:042 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say
           unto him, The son of David.

40:022:043 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him
           Lord, saying,

40:022:044 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I
           make thine enemies thy footstool?

40:022:045 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

40:022:046 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any
           man from that day forth ask him any more questions.

40:023:001 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,

40:023:002 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:

40:023:003 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
           and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do
           not.

40:023:004 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
           them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move
           them with one of their fingers.

40:023:005 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
           broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
           garments,

40:023:006 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
           the synagogues,

40:023:007 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi,
           Rabbi.

40:023:008 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even
           Christ; and all ye are brethren.

40:023:009 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
           Father, which is in heaven.

40:023:010 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even
           Christ.

40:023:011 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.

40:023:012 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
           shall humble himself shall be exalted.

40:023:013 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
           shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go
           in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go
           in.

40:023:014 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
           widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore
           ye shall receive the greater damnation.

40:023:015 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
           compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is
           made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than
           yourselves.

40:023:016 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall
           swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear
           by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!

40:023:017 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the
           temple that sanctifieth the gold?

40:023:018 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but
           whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.

40:023:019 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the
           altar that sanctifieth the gift?

40:023:020 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and
           by all things thereon.

40:023:021 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by
           him that dwelleth therein.

40:023:022 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
           God, and by him that sitteth thereon.

40:023:023 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
           tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the
           weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:
           these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
           undone.

40:023:024 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

40:023:025 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
           clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within
           they are full of extortion and excess.

40:023:026 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the
           cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

40:023:027 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are
           like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful
           outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all
           uncleanness.

40:023:028 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but
           within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

40:023:029 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
           build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of
           the righteous,

40:023:030 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would
           not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
           prophets.

40:023:031 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
           children of them which killed the prophets.

40:023:032 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.

40:023:033 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
           damnation of hell?

40:023:034 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
           scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some
           of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute
           them from city to city:

40:023:035 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the
           earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of
           Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple
           and the altar.

40:023:036 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
           generation.

40:023:037 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
           stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have
           gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
           chickens under her wings, and ye would not!

40:023:038 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

40:023:039 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
           shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

40:024:001 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
           disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the
           temple.

40:024:002 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily
           I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon
           another, that shall not be thrown down.

40:024:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came
           unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things
           be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end
           of the world?

40:024:004 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man
           deceive you.

40:024:005 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
           deceive many.

40:024:006 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be
           not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the
           end is not yet.

40:024:007 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
           kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
           earthquakes, in divers places.

40:024:008 All these are the beginning of sorrows.

40:024:009 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
           you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.

40:024:010 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,
           and shall hate one another.

40:024:011 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

40:024:012 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
           cold.

40:024:013 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be
           saved.

40:024:014 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
           world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
           come.

40:024:015 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
           spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place,
           (whoso readeth, let him understand:)

40:024:016 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:

40:024:017 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any
           thing out of his house:

40:024:018 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his
           clothes.

40:024:019 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
           suck in those days!

40:024:020 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on
           the sabbath day:

40:024:021 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the
           beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

40:024:022 And except those days should be shortened, there should no
           flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
           shortened.

40:024:023 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
           there; believe it not.

40:024:024 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
           shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were
           possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

40:024:025 Behold, I have told you before.

40:024:026 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
           desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers;
           believe it not.

40:024:027 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
           unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

40:024:028 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
           gathered together.

40:024:029 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun
           be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the
           stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens
           shall be shaken:

40:024:030 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:
           and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they
           shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with
           power and great glory.

40:024:031 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
           and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,
           from one end of heaven to the other.

40:024:032 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
           tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:

40:024:033 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that
           it is near, even at the doors.

40:024:034 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till
           all these things be fulfilled.

40:024:035 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
           away.

40:024:036 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
           heaven, but my Father only.

40:024:037 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the
           Son of man be.

40:024:038 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
           and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day
           that Noe entered into the ark,

40:024:039 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so
           shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

40:024:040 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and
           the other left.

40:024:041 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be
           taken, and the other left.

40:024:042 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
           come.

40:024:043 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
           what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and
           would not have suffered his house to be broken up.

40:024:044 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think
           not the Son of man cometh.

40:024:045 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath
           made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due
           season?

40:024:046 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
           find so doing.

40:024:047 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all
           his goods.

40:024:048 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
           delayeth his coming;

40:024:049 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and
           drink with the drunken;

40:024:050 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh
           not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,

40:024:051 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with
           the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

40:025:001 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
           which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

40:025:002 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

40:025:003 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
           them:

40:025:004 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

40:025:005 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

40:025:006 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
           cometh; go ye out to meet him.

40:025:007 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

40:025:008 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for
           our lamps are gone out.

40:025:009 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not
           enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and
           buy for yourselves.

40:025:010 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
           were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was
           shut.

40:025:011 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
           open to us.

40:025:012 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
           not.

40:025:013 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
           wherein the Son of man cometh.

40:025:014 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
           country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them
           his goods.

40:025:015 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
           another one; to every man according to his several ability;
           and straightway took his journey.

40:025:016 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded
           with the same, and made them other five talents.

40:025:017 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other
           two.

40:025:018 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
           hid his lord's money.

40:025:019 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
           reckoneth with them.

40:025:020 And so he that had received five talents came and brought
           other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me
           five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents
           more.

40:025:021 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
           servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
           make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of
           thy lord.

40:025:022 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord,
           thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained
           two other talents beside them.

40:025:023 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
           thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
           ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

40:025:024 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,
           I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast
           not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

40:025:025 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth:
           lo, there thou hast that is thine.

40:025:026 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
           servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and
           gather where I have not strawed:

40:025:027 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the
           exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine
           own with usury.

40:025:028 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
           hath ten talents.

40:025:029 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
           abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even
           that which he hath.

40:025:030 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness:
           there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

40:025:031 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
           angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his
           glory:

40:025:032 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
           separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his
           sheep from the goats:

40:025:033 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on
           the left.

40:025:034 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
           blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
           from the foundation of the world:

40:025:035 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
           ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

40:025:036 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was
           in prison, and ye came unto me.

40:025:037 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
           thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee
           drink?

40:025:038 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and
           clothed thee?

40:025:039 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

40:025:040 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto
           you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
           these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.

40:025:041 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
           me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
           and his angels:

40:025:042 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty,
           and ye gave me no drink:

40:025:043 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed
           me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

40:025:044 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
           thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
           or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

40:025:045 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
           Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did
           it not to me.

40:025:046 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
           righteous into life eternal.

40:026:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these
           sayings, he said unto his disciples,

40:026:002 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and
           the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

40:026:003 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes,
           and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high
           priest, who was called Caiaphas,

40:026:004 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill
           him.

40:026:005 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
           among the people.

40:026:006 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the
           leper,

40:026:007 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
           precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at
           meat.

40:026:008 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying,
           To what purpose is this waste?

40:026:009 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to
           the poor.

40:026:010 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye
           the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

40:026:011 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
           always.

40:026:012 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
           it for my burial.

40:026:013 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
           preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this
           woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

40:026:014 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
           chief priests,

40:026:015 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver
           him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces
           of silver.

40:026:016 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

40:026:017 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
           disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that
           we prepare for thee to eat the passover?

40:026:018 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,
           The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover
           at thy house with my disciples.

40:026:019 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they
           made ready the passover.

40:026:020 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

40:026:021 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one
           of you shall betray me.

40:026:022 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
           to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

40:026:023 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in
           the dish, the same shall betray me.

40:026:024 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto
           that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good
           for that man if he had not been born.

40:026:025 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is
           it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

40:026:026 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
           brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat;
           this is my body.

40:026:027 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
           saying, Drink ye all of it;

40:026:028 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
           many for the remission of sins.

40:026:029 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit
           of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my
           Father's kingdom.

40:026:030 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount
           of Olives.

40:026:031 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because
           of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the
           shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered
           abroad.

40:026:032 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

40:026:033 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
           offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.

40:026:034 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
           before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

40:026:035 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
           not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

40:026:036 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane,
           and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray
           yonder.

40:026:037 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
           began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

40:026:038 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
           unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.

40:026:039 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and
           prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
           pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

40:026:040 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
           saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?

40:026:041 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
           indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

40:026:042 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
           Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink
           it, thy will be done.

40:026:043 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
           heavy.

40:026:044 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
           time, saying the same words.

40:026:045 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
           now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the
           Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

40:026:046 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray
           me.

40:026:047 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came,
           and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from
           the chief priests and elders of the people.

40:026:048 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever
           I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

40:026:049 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
           kissed him.

40:026:050 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
           came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.

40:026:051 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
           his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high
           priest's, and smote off his ear.

40:026:052 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
           place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
           sword.

40:026:053 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
           shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

40:026:054 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
           must be?

40:026:055 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come
           out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?
           I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no
           hold on me.

40:026:056 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets
           might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and
           fled.

40:026:057 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
           the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
           assembled.

40:026:058 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace,
           and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.

40:026:059 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
           false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

40:026:060 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet
           found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,

40:026:061 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of
           God, and to build it in three days.

40:026:062 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
           nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

40:026:063 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and
           said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell
           us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.

40:026:064 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
           you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the
           right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

40:026:065 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
           blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now
           ye have heard his blasphemy.

40:026:066 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.

40:026:067 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
           smote him with the palms of their hands,

40:026:068 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote
           thee?

40:026:069 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto
           him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

40:026:070 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
           sayest.

40:026:071 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
           and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with
           Jesus of Nazareth.

40:026:072 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

40:026:073 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said
           to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech
           bewrayeth thee.

40:026:074 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the
           man. And immediately the cock crew.

40:026:075 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
           Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went
           out, and wept bitterly.

40:027:001 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
           the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:

40:027:002 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered
           him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

40:027:003 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
           condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty
           pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

40:027:004 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent
           blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.

40:027:005 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
           departed, and went and hanged himself.

40:027:006 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is
           not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is
           the price of blood.

40:027:007 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's
           field, to bury strangers in.

40:027:008 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
           day.

40:027:009 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
           prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver,
           the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of
           Israel did value;

40:027:010 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed
           me.

40:027:011 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
           him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said
           unto him, Thou sayest.

40:027:012 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
           answered nothing.

40:027:013 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things
           they witness against thee?

40:027:014 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the
           governor marvelled greatly.

40:027:015 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
           people a prisoner, whom they would.

40:027:016 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

40:027:017 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
           them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus
           which is called Christ?

40:027:018 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

40:027:019 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
           him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I
           have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

40:027:020 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
           they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

40:027:021 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
           will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

40:027:022 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which
           is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

40:027:023 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
           cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

40:027:024 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather
           a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before
           the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just
           person: see ye to it.

40:027:025 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us,
           and on our children.

40:027:026 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
           Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.

40:027:027 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
           hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

40:027:028 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

40:027:029 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
           his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the
           knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the
           Jews!

40:027:030 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on
           the head.

40:027:031 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off
           from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
           crucify him.

40:027:032 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
           name: him they compelled to bear his cross.

40:027:033 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is
           to say, a place of a skull,

40:027:034 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he
           had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

40:027:035 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
           that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
           They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did
           they cast lots.

40:027:036 And sitting down they watched him there;

40:027:037 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS
           THE KING OF THE JEWS.

40:027:038 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the
           right hand, and another on the left.

40:027:039 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

40:027:040 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it
           in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come
           down from the cross.

40:027:041 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
           and elders, said,

40:027:042 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of
           Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
           believe him.

40:027:043 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have
           him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

40:027:044 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same
           in his teeth.

40:027:045 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
           unto the ninth hour.

40:027:046 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
           saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my
           God, why hast thou forsaken me?

40:027:047 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said,
           This man calleth for Elias.

40:027:048 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
           it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

40:027:049 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
           save him.

40:027:050 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up
           the ghost.

40:027:051 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
           top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks
           rent;

40:027:052 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints
           which slept arose,

40:027:053 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went
           into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

40:027:054 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
           Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done,
           they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

40:027:055 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
           Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

40:027:056 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James
           and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.

40:027:057 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
           named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:

40:027:058 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
           commanded the body to be delivered.

40:027:059 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
           linen cloth,

40:027:060 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the
           rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
           sepulchre, and departed.

40:027:061 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
           against the sepulchre.

40:027:062 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,
           the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,

40:027:063 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was
           yet alive, After three days I will rise again.

40:027:064 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
           third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him
           away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so
           the last error shall be worse than the first.

40:027:065 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it
           as sure as ye can.

40:027:066 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
           and setting a watch.

40:028:001 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
           first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
           to see the sepulchre.

40:028:002 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of
           the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the
           stone from the door, and sat upon it.

40:028:003 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
           snow:

40:028:004 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
           men.

40:028:005 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:
           for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

40:028:006 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the
           place where the Lord lay.

40:028:007 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from
           the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there
           shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

40:028:008 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and
           great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.

40:028:009 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met
           them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the
           feet, and worshipped him.

40:028:010 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren
           that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

40:028:011 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into
           the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things
           that were done.

40:028:012 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
           counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,

40:028:013 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him
           away while we slept.

40:028:014 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,
           and secure you.

40:028:015 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this
           saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

40:028:016 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
           mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

40:028:017 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.

40:028:018 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
           unto me in heaven and in earth.

40:028:019 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
           name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

40:028:020 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
           commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
           of the world. Amen.

Book 41        Mark

41:001:001 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

41:001:002 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger
           before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

41:001:003 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
           of the Lord, make his paths straight.

41:001:004 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
           repentance for the remission of sins.

41:001:005 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they
           of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of
           Jordan, confessing their sins.

41:001:006 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a
           skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;

41:001:007 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after
           me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down
           and unloose.

41:001:008 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize
           you with the Holy Ghost.

41:001:009 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from
           Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

41:001:010 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
           opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

41:001:011 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my
           beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

41:001:012 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

41:001:013 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of
           Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
           unto him.

41:001:014 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
           Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

41:001:015 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is
           at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

41:001:016 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
           Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were
           fishers.

41:001:017 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make
           you to become fishers of men.

41:001:018 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

41:001:019 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
           son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the
           ship mending their nets.

41:001:020 And straightway he called them: and they left their father
           Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after
           him.

41:001:021 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath
           day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

41:001:022 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them
           as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

41:001:023 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
           and he cried out,

41:001:024 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
           of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
           art, the Holy One of God.

41:001:025 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
           him.

41:001:026 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a
           loud voice, he came out of him.

41:001:027 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
           themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is
           this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean
           spirits, and they do obey him.

41:001:028 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the
           region round about Galilee.

41:001:029 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
           entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and
           John.

41:001:030 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they
           tell him of her.

41:001:031 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
           immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

41:001:032 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all
           that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

41:001:033 And all the city was gathered together at the door.

41:001:034 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
           out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because
           they knew him.

41:001:035 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he
           went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
           prayed.

41:001:036 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.

41:001:037 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek
           for thee.

41:001:038 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I
           may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.

41:001:039 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee,
           and cast out devils.

41:001:040 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling
           down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst
           make me clean.

41:001:041 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and
           touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

41:001:042 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
           from him, and he was cleansed.

41:001:043 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

41:001:044 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go
           thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy
           cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony
           unto them.

41:001:045 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
           abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly
           enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and
           they came to him from every quarter.

41:002:001 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it
           was noised that he was in the house.

41:002:002 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that
           there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about
           the door: and he preached the word unto them.

41:002:003 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which
           was borne of four.

41:002:004 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
           uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it
           up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

41:002:005 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the
           palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

41:002:006 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and
           reasoning in their hearts,

41:002:007 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins
           but God only?

41:002:008 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they
           so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason
           ye these things in your hearts?

41:002:009 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins
           be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and
           walk?

41:002:010 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
           to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)

41:002:011 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way
           into thine house.

41:002:012 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth
           before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and
           glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.

41:002:013 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
           resorted unto him, and he taught them.

41:002:014 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting
           at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he
           arose and followed him.

41:002:015 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,
           many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and
           his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.

41:002:016 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans
           and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he
           eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?

41:002:017 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole
           have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came
           not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

41:002:018 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast:
           and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John
           and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?

41:002:019 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
           fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have
           the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

41:002:020 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
           away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

41:002:021 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment:
           else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old,
           and the rent is made worse.

41:002:022 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new
           wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the
           bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new
           bottles.

41:002:023 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on
           the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to
           pluck the ears of corn.

41:002:024 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
           sabbath day that which is not lawful?

41:002:025 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when
           he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with
           him?

41:002:026 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the
           high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to
           eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with
           him?

41:002:027 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not
           man for the sabbath:

41:002:028 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

41:003:001 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man
           there which had a withered hand.

41:003:002 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath
           day; that they might accuse him.

41:003:003 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand
           forth.

41:003:004 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
           days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held
           their peace.

41:003:005 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being
           grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the
           man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and
           his hand was restored whole as the other.

41:003:006 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel
           with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

41:003:007 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and
           a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,

41:003:008 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan;
           and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they
           had heard what great things he did, came unto him.

41:003:009 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait
           on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.

41:003:010 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him
           for to touch him, as many as had plagues.

41:003:011 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him,
           and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

41:003:012 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him
           known.

41:003:013 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he
           would: and they came unto him.

41:003:014 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that
           he might send them forth to preach,

41:003:015 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:

41:003:016 And Simon he surnamed Peter;

41:003:017 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James;
           and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:

41:003:018 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and
           Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and
           Simon the Canaanite,

41:003:019 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went
           into an house.

41:003:020 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could
           not so much as eat bread.

41:003:021 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on
           him: for they said, He is beside himself.

41:003:022 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
           Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out
           devils.

41:003:023 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables,
           How can Satan cast out Satan?

41:003:024 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom
           cannot stand.

41:003:025 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot
           stand.

41:003:026 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he
           cannot stand, but hath an end.

41:003:027 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his
           goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he
           will spoil his house.

41:003:028 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the
           sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall
           blaspheme:

41:003:029 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
           forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.

41:003:030 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

41:003:031 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing
           without, sent unto him, calling him.

41:003:032 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him,
           Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.

41:003:033 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my
           brethren?

41:003:034 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and
           said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

41:003:035 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my
           brother, and my sister, and mother.

41:004:001 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was
           gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a
           ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the
           sea on the land.

41:004:002 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them
           in his doctrine,

41:004:003 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

41:004:004 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side,
           and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

41:004:005 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth;
           and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of
           earth:

41:004:006 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had
           no root, it withered away.

41:004:007 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked
           it, and it yielded no fruit.

41:004:008 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang
           up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some
           sixty, and some an hundred.

41:004:009 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him
           hear.

41:004:010 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the
           twelve asked of him the parable.

41:004:011 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the
           mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without,
           all these things are done in parables:

41:004:012 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they
           may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be
           converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.

41:004:013 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
           will ye know all parables?

41:004:014 The sower soweth the word.

41:004:015 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown;
           but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh
           away the word that was sown in their hearts.

41:004:016 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground;
           who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it
           with gladness;

41:004:017 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
           afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the
           word's sake, immediately they are offended.

41:004:018 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear
           the word,

41:004:019 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
           and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and
           it becometh unfruitful.

41:004:020 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear
           the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some
           thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.

41:004:021 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a
           bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?

41:004:022 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested;
           neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come
           abroad.

41:004:023 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

41:004:024 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what
           measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you
           that hear shall more be given.

41:004:025 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,
           from him shall be taken even that which he hath.

41:004:026 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
           seed into the ground;

41:004:027 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should
           spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

41:004:028 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the
           blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

41:004:029 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in
           the sickle, because the harvest is come.

41:004:030 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or
           with what comparison shall we compare it?

41:004:031 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in
           the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:

41:004:032 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than
           all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls
           of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.

41:004:033 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as
           they were able to hear it.

41:004:034 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they
           were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.

41:004:035 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them,
           Let us pass over unto the other side.

41:004:036 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even
           as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other
           little ships.

41:004:037 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into
           the ship, so that it was now full.

41:004:038 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:
           and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not
           that we perish?

41:004:039 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,
           Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great
           calm.

41:004:040 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that
           ye have no faith?

41:004:041 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What
           manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey
           him?

41:005:001 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the
           country of the Gadarenes.

41:005:002 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met
           him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,

41:005:003 Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind
           him, no, not with chains:

41:005:004 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains,
           and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the
           fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.

41:005:005 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
           tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.

41:005:006 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,

41:005:007 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with
           thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by
           God, that thou torment me not.

41:005:008 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean
           spirit.

41:005:009 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying,
           My name is Legion: for we are many.

41:005:010 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out
           of the country.

41:005:011 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of
           swine feeding.

41:005:012 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the
           swine, that we may enter into them.

41:005:013 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits
           went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran
           violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about
           two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.

41:005:014 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and
           in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was
           done.

41:005:015 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with
           the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in
           his right mind: and they were afraid.

41:005:016 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
           possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.

41:005:017 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.

41:005:018 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed
           with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.

41:005:019 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to
           thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done
           for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.

41:005:020 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great
           things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.

41:005:021 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other
           side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the
           sea.

41:005:022 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
           Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,

41:005:023 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at
           the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on
           her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.

41:005:024 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and
           thronged him.

41:005:025 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,

41:005:026 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
           all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew
           worse,

41:005:027 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
           touched his garment.

41:005:028 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be
           whole.

41:005:029 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and
           she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.

41:005:030 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
           out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who
           touched my clothes?

41:005:031 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude
           thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

41:005:032 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

41:005:033 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
           her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the
           truth.

41:005:034 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee
           whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

41:005:035 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the
           synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead:
           why troublest thou the Master any further?

41:005:036 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto
           the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.

41:005:037 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James,
           and John the brother of James.

41:005:038 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and
           seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

41:005:039 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this
           ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

41:005:040 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all
           out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and
           them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was
           lying.

41:005:041 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha
           cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee,
           arise.

41:005:042 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of
           the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great
           astonishment.

41:005:043 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
           commanded that something should be given her to eat.

41:006:001 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country;
           and his disciples follow him.

41:006:002 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
           synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From
           whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this
           which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are
           wrought by his hands?

41:006:003 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of
           James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his
           sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.

41:006:004 But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour,
           but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own
           house.

41:006:005 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his
           hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

41:006:006 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round
           about the villages, teaching.

41:006:007 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them
           forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean
           spirits;

41:006:008 And commanded them that they should take nothing for their
           journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in
           their purse:

41:006:009 But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

41:006:010 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
           house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

41:006:011 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye
           depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a
           testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be
           more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment,
           than for that city.

41:006:012 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

41:006:013 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that
           were sick, and healed them.

41:006:014 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)
           and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead,
           and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

41:006:015 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a
           prophet, or as one of the prophets.

41:006:016 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I
           beheaded: he is risen from the dead.

41:006:017 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and
           bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's
           wife: for he had married her.

41:006:018 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to
           have thy brother's wife.

41:006:019 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
           killed him; but she could not:

41:006:020 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an
           holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many
           things, and heard him gladly.

41:006:021 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
           made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates
           of Galilee;

41:006:022 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and
           danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king
           said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I
           will give it thee.

41:006:023 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
           give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.

41:006:024 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I
           ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

41:006:025 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and
           asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger
           the head of John the Baptist.

41:006:026 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and
           for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.

41:006:027 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded
           his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the
           prison,

41:006:028 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel:
           and the damsel gave it to her mother.

41:006:029 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
           corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

41:006:030 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
           told him all things, both what they had done, and what they
           had taught.

41:006:031 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
           place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going,
           and they had no leisure so much as to eat.

41:006:032 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.

41:006:033 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran
           afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came
           together unto him.

41:006:034 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved
           with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not
           having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.

41:006:035 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto
           him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far
           passed:

41:006:036 Send them away, that they may go into the country round about,
           and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have
           nothing to eat.

41:006:037 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they
           say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of
           bread, and give them to eat?

41:006:038 He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And
           when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.

41:006:039 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon
           the green grass.

41:006:040 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.

41:006:041 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
           looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and
           gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two
           fishes divided he among them all.

41:006:042 And they did all eat, and were filled.

41:006:043 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of
           the fishes.

41:006:044 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand
           men.

41:006:045 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
           ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while
           he sent away the people.

41:006:046 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
           pray.

41:006:047 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea,
           and he alone on the land.

41:006:048 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary
           unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh
           unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by
           them.

41:006:049 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it
           had been a spirit, and cried out:

41:006:050 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he
           talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is
           I; be not afraid.

41:006:051 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased:
           and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and
           wondered.

41:006:052 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their
           heart was hardened.

41:006:053 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
           Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.

41:006:054 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
           him,

41:006:055 And ran through that whole region round about, and began to
           carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he
           was.

41:006:056 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
           country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him
           that they might touch if it were but the border of his
           garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.

41:007:001 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
           scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

41:007:002 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with
           defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found
           fault.

41:007:003 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their
           hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

41:007:004 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
           not. And many other things there be, which they have received
           to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and
           of tables.

41:007:005 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
           disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat
           bread with unwashen hands?

41:007:006 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of
           you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me
           with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

41:007:007 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
           commandments of men.

41:007:008 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition
           of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such
           like things ye do.

41:007:009 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of
           God, that ye may keep your own tradition.

41:007:010 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
           curseth father or mother, let him die the death:

41:007:011 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is
           Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be
           profited by me; he shall be free.

41:007:012 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
           mother;

41:007:013 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition,
           which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.

41:007:014 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
           them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:

41:007:015 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him
           can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those
           are they that defile the man.

41:007:016 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

41:007:017 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
           disciples asked him concerning the parable.

41:007:018 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also?
           Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without
           entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;

41:007:019 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly,
           and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?

41:007:020 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth
           the man.

41:007:021 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil
           thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

41:007:022 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an
           evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

41:007:023 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

41:007:024 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre
           and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man
           know it: but he could not be hid.

41:007:025 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean
           spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

41:007:026 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she
           besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her
           daughter.

41:007:027 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for
           it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it
           unto the dogs.

41:007:028 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
           under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

41:007:029 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is
           gone out of thy daughter.

41:007:030 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone
           out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

41:007:031 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he
           came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts
           of Decapolis.

41:007:032 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an
           impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand
           upon him.

41:007:033 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
           into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;

41:007:034 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him,
           Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

41:007:035 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
           tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.

41:007:036 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more
           he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published
           it;

41:007:037 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
           things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to
           speak.

41:008:001 In those days the multitude being very great, and having
           nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith
           unto them,

41:008:002 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been
           with me three days, and have nothing to eat:

41:008:003 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will
           faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.

41:008:004 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy
           these men with bread here in the wilderness?

41:008:005 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,
           Seven.

41:008:006 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he
           took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to
           his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before
           the people.

41:008:007 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded
           to set them also before them.

41:008:008 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
           broken meat that was left seven baskets.

41:008:009 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent
           them away.

41:008:010 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and
           came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

41:008:011 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,
           seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

41:008:012 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
           generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There
           shall no sign be given unto this generation.

41:008:013 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to
           the other side.

41:008:014 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had
           they in the ship with them more than one loaf.

41:008:015 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven
           of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

41:008:016 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
           have no bread.

41:008:017 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,
           because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither
           understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?

41:008:018 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do
           ye not remember?

41:008:019 When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many
           baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him,
           Twelve.

41:008:020 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full
           of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.

41:008:021 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?

41:008:022 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto
           him, and besought him to touch him.

41:008:023 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the
           town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon
           him, he asked him if he saw ought.

41:008:024 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

41:008:025 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him
           look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

41:008:026 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
           town, nor tell it to any in the town.

41:008:027 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of
           Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples,
           saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?

41:008:028 And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and
           others, One of the prophets.

41:008:029 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
           answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

41:008:030 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

41:008:031 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer
           many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief
           priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
           again.

41:008:032 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began
           to rebuke him.

41:008:033 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
           rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou
           savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that
           be of men.

41:008:034 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
           also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him
           deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

41:008:035 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever
           shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same
           shall save it.

41:008:036 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
           world, and lose his own soul?

41:008:037 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

41:008:038 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in
           this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the
           Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his
           Father with the holy angels.

41:009:001 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be
           some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death,
           till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

41:009:002 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
           John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by
           themselves: and he was transfigured before them.

41:009:003 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as
           no fuller on earth can white them.

41:009:004 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were
           talking with Jesus.

41:009:005 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for
           us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for
           thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

41:009:006 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

41:009:007 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came
           out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

41:009:008 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no
           man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.

41:009:009 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that
           they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the
           Son of man were risen from the dead.

41:009:010 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one
           with another what the rising from the dead should mean.

41:009:011 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias
           must first come?

41:009:012 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and
           restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man,
           that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.

41:009:013 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have
           done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

41:009:014 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude
           about them, and the scribes questioning with them.

41:009:015 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were
           greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.

41:009:016 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?

41:009:017 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have
           brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;

41:009:018 And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth,
           and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to
           thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could
           not.

41:009:019 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long
           shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him
           unto me.

41:009:020 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him,
           straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground,
           and wallowed foaming.

41:009:021 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came
           unto him? And he said, Of a child.

41:009:022 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the
           waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have
           compassion on us, and help us.

41:009:023 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are
           possible to him that believeth.

41:009:024 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said
           with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

41:009:025 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he
           rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf
           spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into
           him.

41:009:026 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him:
           and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

41:009:027 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he
           arose.

41:009:028 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
           privately, Why could not we cast him out?

41:009:029 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing,
           but by prayer and fasting.

41:009:030 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he
           would not that any man should know it.

41:009:031 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of
           man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill
           him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.

41:009:032 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask
           him.

41:009:033 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked
           them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the
           way?

41:009:034 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed
           among themselves, who should be the greatest.

41:009:035 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them,
           If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all,
           and servant of all.

41:009:036 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and
           when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,

41:009:037 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name,
           receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not
           me, but him that sent me.

41:009:038 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
           devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad
           him, because he followeth not us.

41:009:039 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which
           shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of
           me.

41:009:040 For he that is not against us is on our part.

41:009:041 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my
           name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he
           shall not lose his reward.

41:009:042 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that
           believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were
           hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

41:009:043 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
           to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into
           hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

41:009:044 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

41:009:045 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
           to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into
           hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

41:009:046 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

41:009:047 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for
           thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than
           having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:

41:009:048 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

41:009:049 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
           shall be salted with salt.

41:009:050 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness,
           wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have
           peace one with another.

41:010:001 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea
           by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him
           again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.

41:010:002 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for
           a man to put away his wife? tempting him.

41:010:003 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command
           you?

41:010:004 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement,
           and to put her away.

41:010:005 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of
           your heart he wrote you this precept.

41:010:006 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
           female.

41:010:007 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
           cleave to his wife;

41:010:008 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more
           twain, but one flesh.

41:010:009 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
           asunder.

41:010:010 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
           matter.

41:010:011 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
           marry another, committeth adultery against her.

41:010:012 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
           another, she committeth adultery.

41:010:013 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch
           them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.

41:010:014 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto
           them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid
           them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

41:010:015 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
           of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.

41:010:016 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
           blessed them.

41:010:017 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one
           running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what
           shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

41:010:018 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is
           none good but one, that is, God.

41:010:019 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
           kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not,
           Honour thy father and mother.

41:010:020 And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I
           observed from my youth.

41:010:021 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One
           thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and
           give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and
           come, take up the cross, and follow me.

41:010:022 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he
           had great possessions.

41:010:023 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples,
           How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom
           of God!

41:010:024 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
           answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it
           for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of
           God!

41:010:025 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
           than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

41:010:026 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
           themselves, Who then can be saved?

41:010:027 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible,
           but not with God: for with God all things are possible.

41:010:028 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and
           have followed thee.

41:010:029 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is
           no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or
           father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
           sake, and the gospel's,

41:010:030 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
           and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
           lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal
           life.

41:010:031 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.

41:010:032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
           before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they
           were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell
           them what things should happen unto him,

41:010:033 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man
           shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the
           scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall
           deliver him to the Gentiles:

41:010:034 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit
           upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise
           again.

41:010:035 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him,
           saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us
           whatsoever we shall desire.

41:010:036 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?

41:010:037 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
           right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

41:010:038 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye
           drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the
           baptism that I am baptized with?

41:010:039 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye
           shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the
           baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:

41:010:040 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to
           give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.

41:010:041 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased
           with James and John.

41:010:042 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know
           that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles
           exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise
           authority upon them.

41:010:043 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
           among you, shall be your minister:

41:010:044 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of
           all.

41:010:045 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
           minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

41:010:046 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with
           his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus,
           the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

41:010:047 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to
           cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

41:010:048 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he
           cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on
           me.

41:010:049 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And
           they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort,
           rise; he calleth thee.

41:010:050 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.

41:010:051 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
           should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I
           might receive my sight.

41:010:052 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee
           whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed
           Jesus in the way.

41:011:001 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and
           Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his
           disciples,

41:011:002 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against
           you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a
           colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.

41:011:003 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the
           Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him
           hither.

41:011:004 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door
           without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.

41:011:005 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do
           ye, loosing the colt?

41:011:006 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they
           let them go.

41:011:007 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on
           him; and he sat upon him.

41:011:008 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
           branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.

41:011:009 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried,
           saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
           Lord:

41:011:010 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the
           name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.

41:011:011 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and
           when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the
           eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

41:011:012 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was
           hungry:

41:011:013 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if
           haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it,
           he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.

41:011:014 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
           hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.

41:011:015 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple,
           and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple,
           and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats
           of them that sold doves;

41:011:016 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel
           through the temple.

41:011:017 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
           shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye
           have made it a den of thieves.

41:011:018 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how
           they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the
           people was astonished at his doctrine.

41:011:019 And when even was come, he went out of the city.

41:011:020 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
           dried up from the roots.

41:011:021 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master,
           behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.

41:011:022 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

41:011:023 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
           mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and
           shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those
           things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have
           whatsoever he saith.

41:011:024 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when
           ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

41:011:025 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against
           any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you
           your trespasses.

41:011:026 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
           heaven forgive your trespasses.

41:011:027 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the
           temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes,
           and the elders,

41:011:028 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things?
           and who gave thee this authority to do these things?

41:011:029 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you
           one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what
           authority I do these things.

41:011:030 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.

41:011:031 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
           From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

41:011:032 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all
           men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.

41:011:033 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And
           Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what
           authority I do these things.

41:012:001 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man
           planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a
           place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to
           husbandmen, and went into a far country.

41:012:002 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
           might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the
           vineyard.

41:012:003 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

41:012:004 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they
           cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away
           shamefully handled.

41:012:005 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many
           others; beating some, and killing some.

41:012:006 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him
           also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

41:012:007 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
           come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.

41:012:008 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
           vineyard.

41:012:009 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
           and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto
           others.

41:012:010 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
           builders rejected is become the head of the corner:

41:012:011 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

41:012:012 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for
           they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and
           they left him, and went their way.

41:012:013 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
           Herodians, to catch him in his words.

41:012:014 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know
           that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest
           not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth:
           Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

41:012:015 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their
           hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny,
           that I may see it.

41:012:016 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this
           image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.

41:012:017 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the
           things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
           God's. And they marvelled at him.

41:012:018 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
           resurrection; and they asked him, saying,

41:012:019 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave
           his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother
           should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

41:012:020 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
           dying left no seed.

41:012:021 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed:
           and the third likewise.

41:012:022 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
           died also.

41:012:023 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose
           wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

41:012:024 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
           because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?

41:012:025 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry,
           nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in
           heaven.

41:012:026 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in
           the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying,
           I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
           Jacob?

41:012:027 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye
           therefore do greatly err.

41:012:028 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
           together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked
           him, Which is the first commandment of all?

41:012:029 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is,
           Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

41:012:030 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
           with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
           strength: this is the first commandment.

41:012:031 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
           neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater
           than these.

41:012:032 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
           truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

41:012:033 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the
           understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the
           strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than
           all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

41:012:034 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
           him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man
           after that durst ask him any question.

41:012:035 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple,
           How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?

41:012:036 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my
           Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy
           footstool.

41:012:037 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he
           then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.

41:012:038 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
           which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the
           marketplaces,

41:012:039 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms
           at feasts:

41:012:040 Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long
           prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.

41:012:041 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
           people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich
           cast in much.

41:012:042 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two
           mites, which make a farthing.

41:012:043 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
           Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in,
           than all they which have cast into the treasury:

41:012:044 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her
           want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

41:013:001 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith
           unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings
           are here!

41:013:002 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
           buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another,
           that shall not be thrown down.

41:013:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the
           temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him
           privately,

41:013:004 Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the
           sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?

41:013:005 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man
           deceive you:

41:013:006 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
           deceive many.

41:013:007 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
           troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not
           be yet.

41:013:008 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
           kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and
           there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings
           of sorrows.

41:013:009 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
           councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye
           shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a
           testimony against them.

41:013:010 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

41:013:011 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no
           thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye
           premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour,
           that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy
           Ghost.

41:013:012 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
           father the son; and children shall rise up against their
           parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.

41:013:013 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
           that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

41:013:014 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
           by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him
           that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee
           to the mountains:

41:013:015 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the
           house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his
           house:

41:013:016 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to
           take up his garment.

41:013:017 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give
           suck in those days!

41:013:018 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.

41:013:019 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from
           the beginning of the creation which God created unto this
           time, neither shall be.

41:013:020 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
           should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath
           chosen, he hath shortened the days.

41:013:021 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,
           lo, he is there; believe him not:

41:013:022 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall
           shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even
           the elect.

41:013:023 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.

41:013:024 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
           darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,

41:013:025 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in
           heaven shall be shaken.

41:013:026 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds
           with great power and glory.

41:013:027 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together
           his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the
           earth to the uttermost part of heaven.

41:013:028 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
           tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:

41:013:029 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to
           pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.

41:013:030 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass,
           till all these things be done.

41:013:031 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
           away.

41:013:032 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the
           angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

41:013:033 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time
           is.

41:013:034 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
           his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every
           man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

41:013:035 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the
           house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing,
           or in the morning:

41:013:036 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

41:013:037 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

41:014:001 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of
           unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought
           how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.

41:014:002 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
           of the people.

41:014:003 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he
           sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of
           ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box,
           and poured it on his head.

41:014:004 And there were some that had indignation within themselves,
           and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?

41:014:005 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,
           and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against
           her.

41:014:006 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
           wrought a good work on me.

41:014:007 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will
           ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.

41:014:008 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint
           my body to the burying.

41:014:009 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
           preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath
           done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.

41:014:010 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
           priests, to betray him unto them.

41:014:011 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give
           him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

41:014:012 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
           passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we
           go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?

41:014:013 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto
           them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man
           bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.

41:014:014 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
           house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I
           shall eat the passover with my disciples?

41:014:015 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and
           prepared: there make ready for us.

41:014:016 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and
           found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the
           passover.

41:014:017 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.

41:014:018 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto
           you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.

41:014:019 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by
           one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?

41:014:020 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve,
           that dippeth with me in the dish.

41:014:021 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe
           to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it
           for that man if he had never been born.

41:014:022 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
           it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.

41:014:023 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it
           to them: and they all drank of it.

41:014:024 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
           which is shed for many.

41:014:025 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of
           the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of
           God.

41:014:026 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount
           of Olives.

41:014:027 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
           me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
           and the sheep shall be scattered.

41:014:028 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

41:014:029 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
           will not I.

41:014:030 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this
           day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou
           shalt deny me thrice.

41:014:031 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I
           will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

41:014:032 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he
           saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.

41:014:033 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to
           be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;

41:014:034 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto
           death: tarry ye here, and watch.

41:014:035 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and
           prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from
           him.

41:014:036 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
           take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but
           what thou wilt.

41:014:037 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto
           Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?

41:014:038 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit
           truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.

41:014:039 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.

41:014:040 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
           eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.

41:014:041 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on
           now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come;
           behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

41:014:042 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.

41:014:043 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
           twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,
           from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

41:014:044 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
           Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead
           him away safely.

41:014:045 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
           saith, Master, master; and kissed him.

41:014:046 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.

41:014:047 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a
           servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

41:014:048 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
           against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?

41:014:049 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me
           not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.

41:014:050 And they all forsook him, and fled.

41:014:051 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen
           cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold
           on him:

41:014:052 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

41:014:053 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
           assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the
           scribes.

41:014:054 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
           high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself
           at the fire.

41:014:055 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
           against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.

41:014:056 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
           agreed not together.

41:014:057 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
           saying,

41:014:058 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with
           hands, and within three days I will build another made without
           hands.

41:014:059 But neither so did their witness agree together.

41:014:060 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
           saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness
           against thee?

41:014:061 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high
           priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the
           Son of the Blessed?

41:014:062 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting
           on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
           heaven.

41:014:063 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we
           any further witnesses?

41:014:064 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all
           condemned him to be guilty of death.

41:014:065 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
           buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants
           did strike him with the palms of their hands.

41:014:066 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of
           the maids of the high priest:

41:014:067 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him,
           and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.

41:014:068 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
           thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock
           crew.

41:014:069 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
           by, This is one of them.

41:014:070 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by
           said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art
           a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.

41:014:071 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this
           man of whom ye speak.

41:014:072 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind
           the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice,
           thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he
           wept.

41:015:001 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
           consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole
           council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered
           him to Pilate.

41:015:002 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
           answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.

41:015:003 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he
           answered nothing.

41:015:004 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
           behold how many things they witness against thee.

41:015:005 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

41:015:006 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner,
           whomsoever they desired.

41:015:007 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them
           that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder
           in the insurrection.

41:015:008 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
           had ever done unto them.

41:015:009 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto
           you the King of the Jews?

41:015:010 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.

41:015:011 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
           release Barabbas unto them.

41:015:012 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye
           then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the
           Jews?

41:015:013 And they cried out again, Crucify him.

41:015:014 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
           they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

41:015:015 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released
           Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged
           him, to be crucified.

41:015:016 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called
           Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.

41:015:017 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of
           thorns, and put it about his head,

41:015:018 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

41:015:019 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon
           him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.

41:015:020 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from
           him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to
           crucify him.

41:015:021 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming
           out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear
           his cross.

41:015:022 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
           interpreted, The place of a skull.

41:015:023 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he
           received it not.

41:015:024 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
           casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

41:015:025 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

41:015:026 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE
           KING OF THE JEWS.

41:015:027 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
           hand, and the other on his left.

41:015:028 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
           numbered with the transgressors.

41:015:029 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
           and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
           it in three days,

41:015:030 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

41:015:031 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
           with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

41:015:032 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that
           we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him
           reviled him.

41:015:033 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
           whole land until the ninth hour.

41:015:034 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
           Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My
           God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

41:015:035 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said,
           Behold, he calleth Elias.

41:015:036 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on
           a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see
           whether Elias will come to take him down.

41:015:037 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

41:015:038 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
           the bottom.

41:015:039 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
           he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this
           man was the Son of God.

41:015:040 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
           Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses,
           and Salome;

41:015:041 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and
           ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with
           him unto Jerusalem.

41:015:042 And now when the even was come, because it was the
           preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,

41:015:043 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also
           waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto
           Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

41:015:044 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto
           him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while
           dead.

41:015:045 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to
           Joseph.

41:015:046 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him
           in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out
           of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

41:015:047 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where
           he was laid.

41:016:001 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
           mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that
           they might come and anoint him.

41:016:002 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they
           came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

41:016:003 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the
           stone from the door of the sepulchre?

41:016:004 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away:
           for it was very great.

41:016:005 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting
           on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they
           were affrighted.

41:016:006 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
           Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here:
           behold the place where they laid him.

41:016:007 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
           before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said
           unto you.

41:016:008 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for
           they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to
           any man; for they were afraid.

41:016:009 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he
           appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast
           seven devils.

41:016:010 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they
           mourned and wept.

41:016:011 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been
           seen of her, believed not.

41:016:012 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as
           they walked, and went into the country.

41:016:013 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed
           they them.

41:016:014 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
           upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart,
           because they believed not them which had seen him after he was
           risen.

41:016:015 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach
           the gospel to every creature.

41:016:016 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
           believeth not shall be damned.

41:016:017 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name
           shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

41:016:018 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly
           thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the
           sick, and they shall recover.

41:016:019 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received
           up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

41:016:020 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord
           working with them, and confirming the word with signs
           following. Amen.

Book 42        Luke

42:001:001 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
           declaration of those things which are most surely believed
           among us,

42:001:002 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning
           were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;

42:001:003 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of
           all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order,
           most excellent Theophilus,

42:001:004 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein
           thou hast been instructed.

42:001:005 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
           priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife
           was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

42:001:006 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
           commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

42:001:007 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and
           they both were now well stricken in years.

42:001:008 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's
           office before God in the order of his course,

42:001:009 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to
           burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

42:001:010 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at
           the time of incense.

42:001:011 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on
           the right side of the altar of incense.

42:001:012 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell
           upon him.

42:001:013 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
           prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
           and thou shalt call his name John.

42:001:014 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
           at his birth.

42:001:015 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
           drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled
           with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.

42:001:016 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
           their God.

42:001:017 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
           to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
           disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
           prepared for the Lord.

42:001:018 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
           for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.

42:001:019 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
           stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,
           and to shew thee these glad tidings.

42:001:020 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until
           the day that these things shall be performed, because thou
           believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their
           season.

42:001:021 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
           tarried so long in the temple.

42:001:022 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
           perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he
           beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.

42:001:023 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
           ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

42:001:024 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
           herself five months, saying,

42:001:025 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked
           on me, to take away my reproach among men.

42:001:026 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
           unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

42:001:027 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
           house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

42:001:028 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
           highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among
           women.

42:001:029 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast
           in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.

42:001:030 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
           found favour with God.

42:001:031 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
           a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

42:001:032 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
           and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
           David:

42:001:033 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of
           his kingdom there shall be no end.

42:001:034 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
           know not a man?

42:001:035 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
           come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
           thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
           thee shall be called the Son of God.

42:001:036 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
           son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who
           was called barren.

42:001:037 For with God nothing shall be impossible.

42:001:038 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
           according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

42:001:039 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country
           with haste, into a city of Juda;

42:001:040 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted
           Elisabeth.

42:001:041 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation
           of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled
           with the Holy Ghost:

42:001:042 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art
           thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

42:001:043 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should
           come to me?

42:001:044 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in
           mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

42:001:045 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a
           performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.

42:001:046 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,

42:001:047 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

42:001:048 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
           behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

42:001:049 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy
           is his name.

42:001:050 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
           generation.

42:001:051 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the
           proud in the imagination of their hearts.

42:001:052 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them
           of low degree.

42:001:053 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he
           hath sent empty away.

42:001:054 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his
           mercy;

42:001:055 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for
           ever.

42:001:056 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to
           her own house.

42:001:057 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered;
           and she brought forth a son.

42:001:058 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had
           shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

42:001:059 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
           circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the
           name of his father.

42:001:060 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be
           called John.

42:001:061 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is
           called by this name.

42:001:062 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him
           called.

42:001:063 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name
           is John. And they marvelled all.

42:001:064 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,
           and he spake, and praised God.

42:001:065 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all
           these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill
           country of Judaea.

42:001:066 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,
           saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of
           the Lord was with him.

42:001:067 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
           prophesied, saying,

42:001:068 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and
           redeemed his people,

42:001:069 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of
           his servant David;

42:001:070 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been
           since the world began:

42:001:071 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of
           all that hate us;

42:001:072 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember
           his holy covenant;

42:001:073 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

42:001:074 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of
           the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,

42:001:075 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our
           life.

42:001:076 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
           for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his
           ways;

42:001:077 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the
           remission of their sins,

42:001:078 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
           from on high hath visited us,

42:001:079 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow
           of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

42:001:080 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
           deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

42:002:001 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a
           decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be
           taxed.

42:002:002 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
           Syria.)

42:002:003 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

42:002:004 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of
           Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called
           Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)

42:002:005 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with
           child.

42:002:006 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
           accomplished that she should be delivered.

42:002:007 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
           swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was
           no room for them in the inn.

42:002:008 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
           field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

42:002:009 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
           of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

42:002:010 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
           you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
