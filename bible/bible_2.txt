02:015:024 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
           drink?

02:015:025 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree,
           which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
           sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and
           there he proved them,

02:015:026 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the
           LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight,
           and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his
           statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I
           have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that
           healeth thee.

02:015:027 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
           threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the
           waters.

02:016:001 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the
           congregation of the children of Israel came unto the
           wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the
           fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of
           the land of Egypt.

02:016:002 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
           against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

02:016:003 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had
           died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat
           by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for
           ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this
           whole assembly with hunger.

02:016:004 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
           heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a
           certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they
           will walk in my law, or no.

02:016:005 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
           prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as
           much as they gather daily.

02:016:006 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
           even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out
           from the land of Egypt:

02:016:007 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD;
           for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
           are we, that ye murmur against us?

02:016:008 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in
           the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the
           full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye
           murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not
           against us, but against the LORD.

02:016:009 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of
           the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath
           heard your murmurings.

02:016:010 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole
           congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked
           toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD
           appeared in the cloud.

02:016:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:016:012 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak
           unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the
           morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that
           I am the LORD your God.

02:016:013 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
           covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about
           the host.

02:016:014 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
           of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as
           the hoar frost on the ground.

02:016:015 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
           another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses
           said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given
           you to eat.

02:016:016 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
           every man according to his eating, an omer for every man,
           according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for
           them which are in his tents.

02:016:017 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more,
           some less.

02:016:018 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
           had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack;
           they gathered every man according to his eating.

02:016:019 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

02:016:020 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of
           them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and
           stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

02:016:021 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
           eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

02:016:022 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
           as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of
           the congregation came and told Moses.

02:016:023 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said,
           To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake
           that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will
           seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be
           kept until the morning.

02:016:024 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it
           did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

02:016:025 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
           the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

02:016:026 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
           the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

02:016:027 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
           the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

02:016:028 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
           commandments and my laws?

02:016:029 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore
           he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye
           every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
           seventh day.

02:016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day.

02:016:031 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
           was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like
           wafers made with honey.

02:016:032 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
           Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they
           may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness,
           when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

02:016:033 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
           manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for
           your generations.

02:016:034 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
           Testimony, to be kept.

02:016:035 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until
           they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they
           came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

02:016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

02:017:001 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
           from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to
           the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and
           there was no water for the people to drink.

02:017:002 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
           water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide
           ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?

02:017:003 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people
           murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou
           hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children
           and our cattle with thirst?

02:017:004 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto
           this people? they be almost ready to stone me.

02:017:005 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and
           take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith
           thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.

02:017:006 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
           and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out
           of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the
           sight of the elders of Israel.

02:017:007 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
           because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because
           they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

02:017:008 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

02:017:009 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out,
           fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the
           hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

02:017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with
           Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the
           hill.

02:017:011 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
           prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

02:017:012 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
           under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his
           hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other
           side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the
           sun.

02:017:013 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
           the sword.

02:017:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
           book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will
           utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

02:017:015 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
           Jehovahnissi:

02:017:016 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will
           have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

02:018:001 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard
           of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,
           and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;

02:018:002 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife,
           after he had sent her back,

02:018:003 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom;
           for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

02:018:004 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my
           father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the
           sword of Pharaoh:

02:018:005 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his
           wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
           mount of God:

02:018:006 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come
           unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

02:018:007 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did
           obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their
           welfare; and they came into the tent.

02:018:008 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done
           unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all
           the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the
           LORD delivered them.

02:018:009 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had
           done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the
           Egyptians.

02:018:010 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you
           out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
           Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of
           the Egyptians.

02:018:011 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the
           thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

02:018:012 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
           sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of
           Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

02:018:013 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
           people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto
           the evening.

02:018:014 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the
           people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the
           people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people
           stand by thee from morning unto even?

02:018:015 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come
           unto me to enquire of God:

02:018:016 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
           between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes
           of God, and his laws.

02:018:017 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
           doest is not good.

02:018:018 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
           with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not
           able to perform it thyself alone.

02:018:019 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
           shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that
           thou mayest bring the causes unto God:

02:018:020 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew
           them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they
           must do.

02:018:021 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men,
           such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place
           such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of
           hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

02:018:022 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,
           that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every
           small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for
           thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

02:018:023 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then
           thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also
           go to their place in peace.

02:018:024 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did
           all that he had said.

02:018:025 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them
           heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of
           hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

02:018:026 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes
           they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged
           themselves.

02:018:027 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way
           into his own land.

02:019:001 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone
           forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into
           the wilderness of Sinai.

02:019:002 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the
           desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there
           Israel camped before the mount.

02:019:003 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out
           of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of
           Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;

02:019:004 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you
           on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

02:019:005 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
           covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above
           all people: for all the earth is mine:

02:019:006 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy
           nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the
           children of Israel.

02:019:007 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and
           laid before their faces all these words which the LORD
           commanded him.

02:019:008 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the
           LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of
           the people unto the LORD.

02:019:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
           cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and
           believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people
           unto the LORD.

02:019:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
           them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

02:019:011 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD
           will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount
           Sinai.

02:019:012 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
           Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or
           touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be
           surely put to death:

02:019:013 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be
           stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall
           not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up
           to the mount.

02:019:014 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
           sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

02:019:015 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
           come not at your wives.

02:019:016 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that
           there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the
           mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that
           all the people that was in the camp trembled.

02:019:017 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet
           with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

02:019:018 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
           descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as
           the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

02:019:019 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed
           louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a
           voice.

02:019:020 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
           mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount;
           and Moses went up.

02:019:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest
           they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them
           perish.

02:019:022 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD,
           sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

02:019:023 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to
           mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about
           the mount, and sanctify it.

02:019:024 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou
           shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the
           priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD,
           lest he break forth upon them.

02:019:025 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

02:020:001 And God spake all these words, saying,

02:020:002 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land
           of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

02:020:003 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

02:020:004 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
           likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in
           the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

02:020:005 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
           the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
           the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
           generation of them that hate me;

02:020:006 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
           keep my commandments.

02:020:007 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for
           the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
           vain.

02:020:008 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

02:020:009 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

02:020:010 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
           thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
           daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle,
           nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

02:020:011 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
           all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
           LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

02:020:012 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
           upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

02:020:013 Thou shalt not kill.

02:020:014 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

02:020:015 Thou shalt not steal.

02:020:016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

02:020:017 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
           covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his
           maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is
           thy neighbour's.

02:020:018 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
           and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and
           when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

02:020:019 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
           hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

02:020:020 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
           prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye
           sin not.

02:020:021 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
           thick darkness where God was.

02:020:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
           children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you
           from heaven.

02:020:023 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye
           make unto you gods of gold.

02:020:024 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
           thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy
           sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I
           will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

02:020:025 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not
           build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it,
           thou hast polluted it.

02:020:026 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
           nakedness be not discovered thereon.

02:021:001 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

02:021:002 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and
           in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

02:021:003 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he
           were married, then his wife shall go out with him.

02:021:004 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him
           sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her
           master's, and he shall go out by himself.

02:021:005 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my
           wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

02:021:006 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also
           bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master
           shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him
           for ever.

02:021:007 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall
           not go out as the menservants do.

02:021:008 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to
           himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a
           strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt
           deceitfully with her.

02:021:009 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with
           her after the manner of daughters.

02:021:010 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her
           duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

02:021:011 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out
           free without money.

02:021:012 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to
           death.

02:021:013 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his
           hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

02:021:014 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay
           him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he
           may die.

02:021:015 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely
           put to death.

02:021:016 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found
           in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

02:021:017 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be
           put to death.

02:021:018 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a
           stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

02:021:019 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall
           he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of
           his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

02:021:020 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and
           he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

02:021:021 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be
           punished: for he is his money.

02:021:022 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit
           depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be
           surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay
           upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.

02:021:023 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for
           life,

02:021:024 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

02:021:025 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

02:021:026 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his
           maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's
           sake.

02:021:027 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his
           maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's
           sake.

02:021:028 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox
           shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but
           the owner of the ox shall be quit.

02:021:029 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past,
           and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept
           him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall
           be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

02:021:030 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for
           the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

02:021:031 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter,
           according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

02:021:032 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall
           give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox
           shall be stoned.

02:021:033 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit,
           and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

02:021:034 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto
           the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

02:021:035 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they
           shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the
           dead ox also they shall divide.

02:021:036 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,
           and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for
           ox; and the dead shall be his own.

02:022:001 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell
           it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
           sheep.

02:022:002 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,
           there shall no blood be shed for him.

02:022:003 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for
           him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing,
           then he shall be sold for his theft.

02:022:004 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it
           be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

02:022:005 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and
           shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field;
           of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own
           vineyard, shall he make restitution.

02:022:006 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of
           corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed
           therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make
           restitution.

02:022:007 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to
           keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be
           found, let him pay double.

02:022:008 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall
           be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his
           hand unto his neighbour's goods.

02:022:009 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for
           sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which
           another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall
           come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he
           shall pay double unto his neighbour.

02:022:010 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a
           sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or
           driven away, no man seeing it:

02:022:011 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he
           hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the
           owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it
           good.

02:022:012 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto
           the owner thereof.

02:022:013 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness,
           and he shall not make good that which was torn.

02:022:014 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or
           die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make
           it good.

02:022:015 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it
           good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

02:022:016 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with
           her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

02:022:017 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall
           pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

02:022:018 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

02:022:019 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

02:022:020 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he
           shall be utterly destroyed.

02:022:021 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye
           were strangers in the land of Egypt.

02:022:022 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

02:022:023 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me,
           I will surely hear their cry;

02:022:024 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the
           sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children
           fatherless.

02:022:025 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,
           thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay
           upon him usury.

02:022:026 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou
           shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

02:022:027 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin:
           wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he
           crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

02:022:028 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
           people.

02:022:029 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits,
           and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give
           unto me.

02:022:030 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep:
           seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou
           shalt give it me.

02:022:031 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any
           flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to
           the dogs.

02:023:001 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with
           the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

02:023:002 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt
           thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

02:023:003 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

02:023:004 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou
           shalt surely bring it back to him again.

02:023:005 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his
           burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely
           help with him.

02:023:006 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

02:023:007 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and
           righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

02:023:008 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise,
           and perverteth the words of the righteous.

02:023:009 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart
           of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

02:023:010 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
           fruits thereof:

02:023:011 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still;
           that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the
           beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal
           with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

02:023:012 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou
           shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son
           of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

02:023:013 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect:
           and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it
           be heard out of thy mouth.

02:023:014 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

02:023:015 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
           unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time
           appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from
           Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

02:023:016 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours,
           which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of
           ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast
           gathered in thy labours out of the field.

02:023:017 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the
           LORD God.

02:023:018 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened
           bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the
           morning.

02:023:019 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into
           the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
           his mother's milk.

02:023:020 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
           and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

02:023:021 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
           will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

02:023:022 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
           speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
           adversary unto thine adversaries.

02:023:023 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto
           the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the
           Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut
           them off.

02:023:024 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do
           after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and
           quite break down their images.

02:023:025 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy
           bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the
           midst of thee.

02:023:026 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy
           land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

02:023:027 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the
           people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine
           enemies turn their backs unto thee.

02:023:028 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
           Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

02:023:029 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest
           the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply
           against thee.

02:023:030 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,
           until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

02:023:031 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea
           of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I
           will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and
           thou shalt drive them out before thee.

02:023:032 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

02:023:033 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin
           against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a
           snare unto thee.

02:024:001 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and
           Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;
           and worship ye afar off.

02:024:002 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not
           come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

02:024:003 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD,
           and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one
           voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will
           we do.

02:024:004 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early
           in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and
           twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

02:024:005 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered
           burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto
           the LORD.

02:024:006 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and
           half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

02:024:007 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience
           of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will
           we do, and be obedient.

02:024:008 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
           said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath
           made with you concerning all these words.

02:024:009 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy
           of the elders of Israel:

02:024:010 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet
           as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were
           the body of heaven in his clearness.

02:024:011 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his
           hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

02:024:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount,
           and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law,
           and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach
           them.

02:024:013 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up
           into the mount of God.

02:024:014 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we
           come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you:
           if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

02:024:015 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the
           mount.

02:024:016 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the
           cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto
           Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

02:024:017 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire
           on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

02:024:018 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up
           into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and
           forty nights.

02:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an
           offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart
           ye shall take my offering.

02:025:003 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold,
           and silver, and brass,

02:025:004 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
           hair,

02:025:005 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
           wood,

02:025:006 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet
           incense,

02:025:007 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the
           breastplate.

02:025:008 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

02:025:009 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
           tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof,
           even so shall ye make it.

02:025:010 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
           half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
           breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

02:025:011 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without
           shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold
           round about.

02:025:012 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in
           the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one
           side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

02:025:013 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
           with gold.

02:025:014 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of
           the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

02:025:015 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be
           taken from it.

02:025:016 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall
           give thee.

02:025:017 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and
           a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
           breadth thereof.

02:025:018 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work
           shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

02:025:019 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on
           the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the
           cherubims on the two ends thereof.

02:025:020 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high,
           covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces
           shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the
           faces of the cherubims be.

02:025:021 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in
           the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

02:025:022 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee
           from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims
           which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I
           will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

02:025:023 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall
           be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a
           cubit and a half the height thereof.

02:025:024 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a
           crown of gold round about.

02:025:025 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round
           about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border
           thereof round about.

02:025:026 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the
           rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

02:025:027 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the
           staves to bear the table.

02:025:028 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
           them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

02:025:029 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof,
           and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of
           pure gold shalt thou make them.

02:025:030 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

02:025:031 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work
           shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches,
           his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

02:025:032 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three
           branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three
           branches of the candlestick out of the other side:

02:025:033 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower
           in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other
           branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that
           come out of the candlestick.

02:025:034 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto
           almonds, with their knops and their flowers.

02:025:035 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and
           a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two
           branches of the same, according to the six branches that
           proceed out of the candlestick.

02:025:036 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it
           shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

02:025:037 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall
           light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against
           it.

02:025:038 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be
           of pure gold.

02:025:039 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these
           vessels.

02:025:040 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was
           shewed thee in the mount.

02:026:001 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of
           fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with
           cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.

02:026:002 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits,
           and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of
           the curtains shall have one measure.

02:026:003 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;
           and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.

02:026:004 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one
           curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt
           thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the
           coupling of the second.

02:026:005 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty
           loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in
           the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one
           of another.

02:026:006 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the
           curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one
           tabernacle.

02:026:007 And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering
           upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

02:026:008 The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the
           breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains
           shall be all of one measure.

02:026:009 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six
           curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in
           the forefront of the tabernacle.

02:026:010 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain
           that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge
           of the curtain which coupleth the second.

02:026:011 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches
           into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be
           one.

02:026:012 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,
           the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside
           of the tabernacle.

02:026:013 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of
           that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the
           tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this
           side and on that side, to cover it.

02:026:014 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins
           dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.

02:026:015 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
           standing up.

02:026:016 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a
           half shall be the breadth of one board.

02:026:017 Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one
           against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of
           the tabernacle.

02:026:018 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty
           boards on the south side southward.

02:026:019 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty
           boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and
           two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

02:026:020 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side
           there shall be twenty boards:

02:026:021 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
           board, and two sockets under another board.

02:026:022 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make
           six boards.

02:026:023 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the
           tabernacle in the two sides.

02:026:024 And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be
           coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus
           shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

02:026:025 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver,
           sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets
           under another board.

02:026:026 And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards
           of the one side of the tabernacle,

02:026:027 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
           tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the
           tabernacle, for the two sides westward.

02:026:028 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from
           end to end.

02:026:029 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their
           rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay
           the bars with gold.

02:026:030 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
           thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.

02:026:031 And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it
           be made:

02:026:032 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood
           overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the
           four sockets of silver.

02:026:033 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou
           mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the
           testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy
           place and the most holy.

02:026:034 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the
           testimony in the most holy place.

02:026:035 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the
           candlestick over against the table on the side of the
           tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on
           the north side.

02:026:036 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of
           blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought
           with needlework.

02:026:037 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim
           wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of
           gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

02:027:001 And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits
           long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare:
           and the height thereof shall be three cubits.

02:027:002 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners
           thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt
           overlay it with brass.

02:027:003 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his
           shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans:
           all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.

02:027:004 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and
           upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four
           corners thereof.

02:027:005 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath,
           that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.

02:027:006 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim
           wood, and overlay them with brass.

02:027:007 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves
           shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.

02:027:008 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee
           in the mount, so shall they make it.

02:027:009 And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south
           side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine
           twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side:

02:027:010 And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall
           be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall
           be of silver.

           their twenty sockets of brass; the hooks of the pillars and
           their fillets of silver.

02:027:012 And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be
           hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets
           ten.

02:027:013 And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall
           be fifty cubits.

02:027:014 The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits:
           their pillars three, and their sockets three.

02:027:015 And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their

02:027:016 And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty
           cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined
           linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be

           brass.

02:027:018 The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the
           breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits of fine
           twined linen, and their sockets of brass.

02:027:019 All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof,
           and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall
           be of brass.

02:027:020 And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring
           thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to
           burn always.

02:027:021 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which
           is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it
           from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute
           for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children
           of Israel.

02:028:001 And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
           him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister
           unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu,
           Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.

02:028:002 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for
           glory and for beauty.

02:028:003 And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I
           have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make
           Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto
           me in the priest's office.

02:028:004 And these are the garments which they shall make; a
           breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a
           mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for
           Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me
           in the priest's office.

02:028:005 And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine linen.

02:028:006 And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple,
           of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.

02:028:007 It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two
           edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.

02:028:008 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall
           be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold,
           of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

02:028:009 And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the
           names of the children of Israel:

02:028:010 Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of
           the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.

02:028:011 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of
           a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of
           the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in
           ouches of gold.

02:028:012 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the
           ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and
           Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two
           shoulders for a memorial.

02:028:013 And thou shalt make ouches of gold;

02:028:014 And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work
           shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the
           ouches.

02:028:015 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
           work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold,
           of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined
           linen, shalt thou make it.

02:028:016 Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the
           length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

02:028:017 And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of
           stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a
           carbuncle: this shall be the first row.

02:028:018 And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a
           diamond.

02:028:019 And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

02:028:020 And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they
           shall be set in gold in their inclosings.

02:028:021 And the stones shall be with the names of the children of
           Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
           of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according
           to the twelve tribes.

02:028:022 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of
           wreathen work of pure gold.

02:028:023 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold,
           and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the
           breastplate.

02:028:024 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two
           rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.

02:028:025 And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt
           fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces
           of the ephod before it.

02:028:026 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them
           upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof,
           which is in the side of the ephod inward.

02:028:027 And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put
           them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the
           forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof,
           above the curious girdle of the ephod.

02:028:028 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto
           the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be
           above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the
           breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.

02:028:029 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in
           the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in
           unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD
           continually.

02:028:030 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
           the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he
           goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of
           the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD
           continually.

02:028:031 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

02:028:032 And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst
           thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the
           hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be
           not rent.

02:028:033 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
           blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem
           thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:

02:028:034 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a
           pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.

02:028:035 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be
           heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD,
           and when he cometh out, that he die not.

02:028:036 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it,
           like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

02:028:037 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the
           mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

02:028:038 And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the
           iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel
           shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always
           upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.

02:028:039 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou
           shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the
           girdle of needlework.

02:028:040 And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt
           make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them,
           for glory and for beauty.

02:028:041 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
           with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and
           sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's
           office.

02:028:042 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their
           nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall
           reach:

02:028:043 And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they
           come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they
           come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that
           they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for
           ever unto him and his seed after him.

02:029:001 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
           them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one
           young bullock, and two rams without blemish,

02:029:002 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil,
           and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour
           shalt thou make them.

02:029:003 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the
           basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

02:029:004 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with
           water.

02:029:005 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat,
           and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate,
           and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:

02:029:006 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy
           crown upon the mitre.

02:029:007 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his
           head, and anoint him.

02:029:008 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

02:029:009 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and
           put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be
           theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate
           Aaron and his sons.

02:029:010 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
           tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall
           put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

02:029:011 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door
           of the tabernacle of the congregation.

02:029:012 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it
           upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the
           blood beside the bottom of the altar.

02:029:013 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and
           the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the
           fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

02:029:014 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung,
           shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin
           offering.

02:029:015 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
           their hands upon the head of the ram.

02:029:016 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood,
           and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

02:029:017 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of
           him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his
           head.

02:029:018 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a
           burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD.

02:029:019 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons
           shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

02:029:020 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put
           it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of
           the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right
           hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle
           the blood upon the altar round about.

02:029:021 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and
           of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his
           garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons
           with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his
           sons, and his sons' garments with him.

02:029:022 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the
           fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver,
           and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the
           right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

02:029:023 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one
           wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before
           the LORD:

02:029:024 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands
           of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before
           the LORD.

02:029:025 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon
           the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the
           LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

02:029:026 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's
           consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD:
           and it shall be thy part.

02:029:027 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and
           the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which
           is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that
           which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:

02:029:028 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever
           from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and
           it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of
           the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave
           offering unto the LORD.

02:029:029 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him,
           to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

02:029:030 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on
           seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the
           congregation to minister in the holy place.

02:029:031 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe
           his flesh in the holy place.

02:029:032 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the
           bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of
           the congregation.

02:029:033 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
           made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall
           not eat thereof, because they are holy.

02:029:034 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the
           bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the
           remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is
           holy.

02:029:035 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according
           to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt
           thou consecrate them.

02:029:036 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering
           for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou
           hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to
           sanctify it.

02:029:037 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and
           sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever
           toucheth the altar shall be holy.

02:029:038 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two
           lambs of the first year day by day continually.

02:029:039 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other
           lamb thou shalt offer at even:

02:029:040 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the
           fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an
           hin of wine for a drink offering.

02:029:041 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do
           thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and
           according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour,
           an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

02:029:042 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
           generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
           before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto
           thee.

02:029:043 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
           tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

02:029:044 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and
           the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to
           minister to me in the priest's office.

02:029:045 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be
           their God.

02:029:046 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought
           them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among
           them: I am the LORD their God.

02:030:001 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim
           wood shalt thou make it.

02:030:002 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
           thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the
           height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.

02:030:003 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and
           the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou
           shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

02:030:004 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of
           it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt
           thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to
           bear it withal.

02:030:005 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
           them with gold.

02:030:006 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of
           the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the
           testimony, where I will meet with thee.

02:030:007 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when
           he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

02:030:008 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
           incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD
           throughout your generations.

02:030:009 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt
           sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink
           offering thereon.

02:030:010 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in
           a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once
           in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your
           generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

02:030:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:030:012 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their
           number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul
           unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no
           plague among them, when thou numberest them.

02:030:013 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that
           are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary:
           (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the
           offering of the LORD.

02:030:014 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from
           twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the
           LORD.

02:030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less
           than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD,
           to make an atonement for your souls.

02:030:016 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
           Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle
           of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the
           children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for
           your souls.

02:030:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:030:018 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of
           brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the
           tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt
           put water therein.

02:030:019 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
           thereat:

02:030:020 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they
           shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come
           near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire
           unto the LORD:

02:030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die
           not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him
           and to his seed throughout their generations.

02:030:022 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:030:023 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five
           hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two
           hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred
           and fifty shekels,

02:030:024 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
           sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

02:030:025 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment
           compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy
           anointing oil.

02:030:026 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
           therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

02:030:027 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his
           vessels, and the altar of incense,

02:030:028 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the
           laver and his foot.

02:030:029 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
           whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

02:030:030 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,
           that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

02:030:031 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This
           shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your
           generations.

02:030:032 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make
           any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy,
           and it shall be holy unto you.

02:030:033 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of
           it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

02:030:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
           stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure
           frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:

02:030:035 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art
           of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

02:030:036 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it
           before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation,
           where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

02:030:037 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not
           make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it
           shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

02:030:038 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall
           even be cut off from his people.

02:031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:031:002 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
           Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

02:031:003 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and
           in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
           workmanship,

02:031:004 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and
           in brass,

02:031:005 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
           timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

02:031:006 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of
           Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that
           are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all
           that I have commanded thee;

02:031:007 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the
           testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the
           furniture of the tabernacle,

02:031:008 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with
           all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

02:031:009 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and
           the laver and his foot,

02:031:010 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the
           priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the
           priest's office,

02:031:011 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place:
           according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

02:031:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:031:013 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my
           sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you
           throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the
           LORD that doth sanctify you.

02:031:014 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:
           every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for
           whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off
           from among his people.

02:031:015 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath
           of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the
           sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

02:031:016 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
           observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a
           perpetual covenant.

02:031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
           for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the
           seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

02:031:018 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
           with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of
           stone, written with the finger of God.

02:032:001 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
           the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron,
           and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us;
           for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
           land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

02:032:002 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
           are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your
           daughters, and bring them unto me.

02:032:003 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
           their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

02:032:004 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
           graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they
           said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out
           of the land of Egypt.

02:032:005 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron
           made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

02:032:006 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
           offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat
           down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

02:032:007 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy
           people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have
           corrupted themselves:

02:032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I
           commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have
           worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These
           be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the
           land of Egypt.

02:032:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
           behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

02:032:010 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
           them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a
           great nation.

02:032:011 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
           thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought
           forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a
           mighty hand?

02:032:012 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
           did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
           consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce
           wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.

02:032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom
           thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will
           multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land
           that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they
           shall inherit it for ever.

02:032:014 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
           his people.

02:032:015 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
           tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were
           written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
           were they written.

02:032:016 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
           writing of God, graven upon the tables.

02:032:017 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
           he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

02:032:018 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for
           mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being
           overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.

02:032:019 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,
           that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed
           hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them
           beneath the mount.

02:032:020 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
           fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water,
           and made the children of Israel drink of it.

02:032:021 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee,
           that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?

02:032:022 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou
           knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.

02:032:023 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:
           for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
           land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

02:032:024 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
           it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and
           there came out this calf.

02:032:025 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had
           made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

02:032:026 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on
           the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of
           Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

02:032:027 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put
           every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate
           to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother,
           and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

02:032:028 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
           and there fell of the people that day about three thousand
           men.

02:032:029 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
           even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may
           bestow upon you a blessing this day.

02:032:030 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
           people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto
           the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

02:032:031 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people
           have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

02:032:032 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot
           me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

02:032:033 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against
           me, him will I blot out of my book.

02:032:034 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I
           have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before
           thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their
           sin upon them.

02:032:035 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
           which Aaron made.

02:033:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou
           and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of
           Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and
           to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:

02:033:002 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the
           Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,
           the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

02:033:003 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up
           in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest
           I consume thee in the way.

02:033:004 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned:
           and no man did put on him his ornaments.

02:033:005 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of
           Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the
           midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put
           off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto
           thee.

02:033:006 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their
           ornaments by the mount Horeb.

02:033:007 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the
           camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of
           the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which
           sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the
           congregation, which was without the camp.

02:033:008 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
           that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent
           door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the
           tabernacle.

02:033:009 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the
           cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the
           tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.

02:033:010 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the
           tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped,
           every man in his tent door.

02:033:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
           unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his
           servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out
           of the tabernacle.

02:033:012 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring
           up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt
           send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and
           thou hast also found grace in my sight.

02:033:013 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy
           sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may
           find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy
           people.

02:033:014 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give
           thee rest.

02:033:015 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
           not up hence.

02:033:016 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
           found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with
           us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the
           people that are upon the face of the earth.

02:033:017 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
           thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I
           know thee by name.

02:033:018 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

02:033:019 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and
           I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be
           gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on
           whom I will shew mercy.

02:033:020 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no
           man see me, and live.

02:033:021 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
           shalt stand upon a rock:

02:033:022 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I
           will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with
           my hand while I pass by:

02:033:023 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back
           parts: but my face shall not be seen.

02:034:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone
           like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the
           words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

02:034:002 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
           mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the
           mount.

02:034:003 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be
           seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor
           herds feed before that mount.

02:034:004 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and
           Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount
           Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the
           two tables of stone.

02:034:005 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
           and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

02:034:006 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD,
           The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
           abundant in goodness and truth,

02:034:007 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
           transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the
           guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
           children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and
           to the fourth generation.

02:034:008 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
           worshipped.

02:034:009 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD,
           let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked
           people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for
           thine inheritance.

02:034:010 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people
           I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the
           earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou
           art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing
           that I will do with thee.

02:034:011 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I
           drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the
           Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

02:034:012 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
           inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a
           snare in the midst of thee:

02:034:013 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut
           down their groves:

02:034:014 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name
           is Jealous, is a jealous God:

02:034:015 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
           and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto
           their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

02:034:016 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their
           daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go
           a whoring after their gods.

02:034:017 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

02:034:018 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou
           shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time
           of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from
           Egypt.

02:034:019 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
           thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

02:034:020 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and
           if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All
           the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall
           appear before me empty.

02:034:021 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
           rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

02:034:022 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits
           of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's
           end.

02:034:023 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before
           the LORD God, the God of Israel.

02:034:024 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
           borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou
           shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the
           year.

02:034:025 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
           neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be
           left unto the morning.

02:034:026 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
           the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
           his mother's milk.

02:034:027 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for
           after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with
           thee and with Israel.

02:034:028 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he
           did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the
           tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

02:034:029 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
           with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came
           down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his
           face shone while he talked with him.

02:034:030 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,
           behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to
           come nigh him.

02:034:031 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of
           the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with
           them.

02:034:032 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he
           gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him
           in mount Sinai.

02:034:033 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on
           his face.

02:034:034 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
           took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and
           spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

02:034:035 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the
           skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his
           face again, until he went in to speak with him.

02:035:001 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of
           Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which
           the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.

02:035:002 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there
           shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD:
           whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

02:035:003 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
           sabbath day.

02:035:004 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
           Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded,
           saying,

02:035:005 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is
           of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD;
           gold, and silver, and brass,

02:035:006 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
           hair,

02:035:007 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
           wood,

02:035:008 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for
           the sweet incense,

02:035:009 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for
           the breastplate.

02:035:010 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that
           the LORD hath commanded;

02:035:011 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and
           his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,

02:035:012 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the
           vail of the covering,

02:035:013 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the
           shewbread,

02:035:014 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his
           lamps, with the oil for the light,

02:035:015 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,
           and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the
           entering in of the tabernacle,

02:035:016 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his
           staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

02:035:017 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and
           the hanging for the door of the court,

02:035:018 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and
           their cords,

02:035:019 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the
           holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his
           sons, to minister in the priest's office.

02:035:020 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed
           from the presence of Moses.

02:035:021 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every
           one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's
           offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation,
           and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

02:035:022 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
           hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and
           tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered
           offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.

02:035:023 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
           scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of
           rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

02:035:024 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass
           brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was
           found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

02:035:025 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
           hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and
           of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

02:035:026 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
           goats' hair.

02:035:027 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for
           the ephod, and for the breastplate;

02:035:028 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil,
           and for the sweet incense.

02:035:029 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the
           LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to
           bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to
           be made by the hand of Moses.

02:035:030 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath
           called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the
           tribe of Judah;

02:035:031 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
           understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
           workmanship;

02:035:032 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver,
           and in brass,

02:035:033 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
           wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

02:035:034 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
           Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

02:035:035 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner
           of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of
           the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in
           fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work,
           and of those that devise cunning work.

02:036:001 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man,
           in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to
           work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary,
           according to all that the LORD had commanded.

02:036:002 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
           man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one
           whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:

02:036:003 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the
           children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of
           the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto
           him free offerings every morning.

02:036:004 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the
           sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;

02:036:005 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more
           than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD
           commanded to make.

02:036:006 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be
           proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor
           woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So
           the people were restrained from bringing.

02:036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
           it, and too much.

02:036:008 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
           the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and
           blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work
           made he them.

02:036:009 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
           breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of
           one size.

02:036:010 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the
           other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

02:036:011 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
           selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost
           side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

02:036:012 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in
           the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the
           second: the loops held one curtain to another.

02:036:013 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one
           unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

02:036:014 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
           tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

02:036:015 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits
           was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of
           one size.

02:036:016 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
           by themselves.

02:036:017 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
           in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the
           curtain which coupleth the second.

02:036:018 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,
           that it might be one.

02:036:019 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
           and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

02:036:020 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood,
           standing up.

02:036:021 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a
           board one cubit and a half.

02:036:022 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another:
           thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

02:036:023 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
           south side southward:

02:036:024 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
           two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two
           sockets under another board for his two tenons.

02:036:025 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the
           north corner, he made twenty boards,

02:036:026 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
           board, and two sockets under another board.

02:036:027 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six
           boards.

02:036:028 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in
           the two sides.

02:036:029 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the
           head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both
           the corners.

02:036:030 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen
           sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

02:036:031 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the
           one side of the tabernacle,

02:036:032 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
           tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for
           the sides westward.

02:036:033 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from
           the one end to the other.

02:036:034 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of
           gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with
           gold.

02:036:035 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
           twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

02:036:036 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and
           overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast
           for them four sockets of silver.

02:036:037 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
           purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

02:036:038 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid
           their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five
           sockets were of brass.

02:037:001 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
           half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth
           of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:

02:037:002 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made
           a crown of gold to it round about.

02:037:003 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four
           corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two
           rings upon the other side of it.

02:037:004 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           gold.

02:037:005 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
           to bear the ark.

02:037:006 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half
           was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth
           thereof.

02:037:007 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece
           made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

02:037:008 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the
           other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the
           cherubims on the two ends thereof.

02:037:009 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered
           with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to
           another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the
           cherubims.

02:037:010 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the
           length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit
           and a half the height thereof:

02:037:011 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown
           of gold round about.

02:037:012 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
           and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

02:037:013 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon
           the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

02:037:014 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the
           staves to bear the table.

02:037:015 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           gold, to bear the table.

02:037:016 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,
           and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal,
           of pure gold.

02:037:017 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made
           he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his
           knops, and his flowers, were of the same:

02:037:018 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three
           branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and
           three branches of the candlestick out of the other side
           thereof:

02:037:019 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a
           knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in
           another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six
           branches going out of the candlestick.

02:037:020 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his
           knops, and his flowers:

02:037:021 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under
           two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the
           same, according to the six branches going out of it.

02:037:022 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was
           one beaten work of pure gold.

02:037:023 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his
           snuffdishes, of pure gold.

02:037:024 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels
           thereof.

02:037:025 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of
           it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was
           foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns
           thereof were of the same.

02:037:026 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the
           sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made
           unto it a crown of gold round about.

02:037:027 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof,
           by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be
           places for the staves to bear it withal.

02:037:028 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           gold.

02:037:029 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of
           sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

02:038:001 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five
           cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth
           thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height
           thereof.

02:038:002 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the
           horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

02:038:003 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the
           shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans:
           all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

02:038:004 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the
           compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

02:038:005 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of
           brass, to be places for the staves.

02:038:006 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           brass.

02:038:007 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the
           altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with
           boards.

02:038:008 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass,
           of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled
           at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

02:038:009 And he made the court: on the south side southward the
           hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred
           cubits:

02:038:010 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty;
           the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

02:038:011 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits,
           their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty;
           the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

02:038:012 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their
           pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars
           and their fillets of silver.

02:038:013 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

02:038:014 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits;
           their pillars three, and their sockets three.

02:038:015 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and
           that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars
           three, and their sockets three.

02:038:016 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined
           linen.

02:038:017 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of
           the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of
           their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court
           were filleted with silver.

02:038:018 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of
           blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and
           twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth
           was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

02:038:019 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;
           their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters
           and their fillets of silver.

02:038:020 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round
           about, were of brass.

02:038:021 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
           testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of
           Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar,
           son to Aaron the priest.

02:038:022 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
           Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

02:038:023 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of
           Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in
           blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

02:038:024 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of
           the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and
           nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the
           shekel of the sanctuary.

02:038:025 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
           was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and
           threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the
           sanctuary:

02:038:026 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the
           shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be
           numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred
           thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.

02:038:027 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of
           the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets
           of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

02:038:028 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he
           made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and
           filleted them.

02:038:029 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two
           thousand and four hundred shekels.

02:038:030 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the
           brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

02:038:031 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of
           the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all
           the pins of the court round about.

02:039:001 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
           service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy
           garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:002 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine twined linen.

02:039:003 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into
           wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the
           scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

02:039:004 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the
           two edges was it coupled together.

02:039:005 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of
           the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and
           purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:039:006 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold,
           graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children
           of Israel.

02:039:007 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they
           should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as
           the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:008 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of
           the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
           twined linen.

02:039:009 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span
           was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being
           doubled.

02:039:010 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a
           sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

02:039:011 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

02:039:012 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

02:039:013 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were
           inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

02:039:014 And the stones were according to the names of the children of
           Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
           of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve
           tribes.

02:039:015 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of
           wreathen work of pure gold.

02:039:016 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put
           the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

02:039:017 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings
           on the ends of the breastplate.

02:039:018 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in
           the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the
           ephod, before it.

02:039:019 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends
           of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the
           side of the ephod inward.

02:039:020 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two
           sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over
           against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle
           of the ephod.

02:039:021 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings
           of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the
           curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might
           not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:022 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

02:039:023 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of
           an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should
           not rend.

02:039:024 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,
           and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

02:039:025 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between
           the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between
           the pomegranates;

02:039:026 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round
           about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:039:027 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and
           for his sons,

02:039:028 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen,
           and linen breeches of fine twined linen,

02:039:029 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
           scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:030 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and
           wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet,
           HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

02:039:031 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high
           upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:032 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
           congregation finished: and the children of Israel did
           according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

02:039:033 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all
           his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his
           pillars, and his sockets,

02:039:034 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of
           badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

02:039:035 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the
           mercy seat,

02:039:036 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

02:039:037 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the
           lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the
           oil for light,

02:039:038 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
           incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

02:039:039 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all
           his vessels, the laver and his foot,

02:039:040 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and
           the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and
           all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent
           of the congregation,

02:039:041 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the
           holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to
           minister in the priest's office.

02:039:042 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the
           children of Israel made all the work.

02:039:043 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had
           done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it:
           and Moses blessed them.

02:040:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:040:002 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the
           tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

02:040:003 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
           the ark with the vail.

02:040:004 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
           that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in
           the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

02:040:005 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before
           the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to
           the tabernacle.

02:040:006 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
           door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

02:040:007 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the
           congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

02:040:008 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
           hanging at the court gate.

02:040:009 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the
           tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and
           all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

02:040:010 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
           his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar
           most holy.

02:040:011 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

02:040:012 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

02:040:013 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint
           him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the
           priest's office.

02:040:014 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

02:040:015 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father,
           that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for
           their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood
           throughout their generations.

02:040:016 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him,
           so did he.

02:040:017 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
           the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

02:040:018 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
           and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof,
           and reared up his pillars.

02:040:019 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
           covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

02:040:020 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
           staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

02:040:021 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the
           vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as
           the LORD commanded Moses.

02:040:022 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
           side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

02:040:023 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
           LORD had commanded Moses.

02:040:024 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,
           over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle
           southward.

02:040:025 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:040:026 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
           before the vail:

02:040:027 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

02:040:028 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

02:040:029 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
           tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon
           it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:040:030 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
           the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

02:040:031 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
           feet thereat:

02:040:032 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when
           they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:040:033 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
           altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses
           finished the work.

02:040:034 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
           glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

02:040:035 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
           congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
           of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

02:040:036 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
           children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

02:040:037 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not
           till the day that it was taken up.

02:040:038 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
           fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of
           Israel, throughout all their journeys.

Book 03        Leviticus

03:001:001 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

03:001:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
           man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring
           your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the
           flock.

03:001:003 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him
           offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own
           voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation before the LORD.

03:001:004 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering;
           and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

03:001:005 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the
           priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the
           blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation.

03:001:006 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his
           pieces.

03:001:007 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the
           altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

03:001:008 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head,
           and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which
           is upon the altar:

03:001:009 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the
           priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice,
           an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:001:010 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or
           of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male
           without blemish.

03:001:011 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
           the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his
           blood round about upon the altar.

03:001:012 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his
           fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that
           is on the fire which is upon the altar:

03:001:013 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the
           priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a
           burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
           unto the LORD.

03:001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of
           fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of
           young pigeons.

03:001:015 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off
           his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof
           shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

03:001:016 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast
           it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the
           ashes:

03:001:017 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not
           divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the
           altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt
           sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
           the LORD.

03:002:001 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his
           offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon
           it, and put frankincense thereon:

03:002:002 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he
           shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of
           the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the
           priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an
           offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:

03:002:003 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his
           sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD
           made by fire.

03:002:004 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
           oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with
           oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

03:002:005 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it
           shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

03:002:006 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a
           meat offering.

03:002:007 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan,
           it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

03:002:008 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
           things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the
           priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.

03:002:009 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
           thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering
           made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:002:010 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's
           and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the
           LORD made by fire.

03:002:011 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
           made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey,
           in any offering of the LORD made by fire.

03:002:012 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them
           unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a
           sweet savour.

03:002:013 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
           salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of
           thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine
           offerings thou shalt offer salt.

03:002:014 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
           LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy
           firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn
           beaten out of full ears.

03:002:015 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon:
           it is a meat offering.

03:002:016 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the
           beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the
           frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the
           LORD.

03:003:001 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he
           offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall
           offer it without blemish before the LORD.

03:003:002 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
           kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and
           Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the
           altar round about.

03:003:003 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the
           inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

03:003:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
           the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
           shall he take away.

03:003:005 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
           sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is
           an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:003:006 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the
           LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it
           without blemish.

03:003:007 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it
           before the LORD.

03:003:008 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
           kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's
           sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the
           altar.

03:003:009 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the
           whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the
           fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon
           the inwards,

03:003:010 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
           by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
           it shall he take away.

03:003:011 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of
           the offering made by fire unto the LORD.

03:003:012 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before
           the LORD.

03:003:013 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it
           before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of
           Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round
           about.

03:003:014 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made
           by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and
           all the fat that is upon the inwards,

03:003:015 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
           by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
           it shall he take away.

03:003:016 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food
           of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat
           is the LORD's.

03:003:017 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations
           throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor
           blood.

03:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:004:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin
           through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD
           concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do
           against any of them:

03:004:003 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of
           the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath
           sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a
           sin offering.

03:004:004 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand
           upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

03:004:005 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's
           blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

03:004:006 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle
           of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of
           the sanctuary.

03:004:007 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of
           the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the
           tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood
           of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt
           offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

03:004:008 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for
           the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all
           the fat that is upon the inwards,

03:004:009 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
           by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
           it shall he take away,

03:004:010 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
           offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of
           the burnt offering.

03:004:011 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,
           and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

03:004:012 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp
           unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn
           him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out
           shall he be burnt.

03:004:013 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
           and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they
           have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD
           concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

03:004:014 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known,
           then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin,
           and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:004:015 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon
           the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall
           be killed before the LORD.

03:004:016 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
           blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

03:004:017 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and
           sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

03:004:018 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
           which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom
           of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:004:019 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the
           altar.

03:004:020 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock
           for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest
           shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven
           them.

03:004:021 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and
           burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering
           for the congregation.

03:004:022 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
           against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning
           things which should not be done, and is guilty;

03:004:023 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge;
           he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male
           without blemish:

03:004:024 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill
           it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the
           LORD: it is a sin offering.

03:004:025 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
           with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
           burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of
           the altar of burnt offering.

03:004:026 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of
           the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an
           atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be
           forgiven him.

03:004:027 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,
           while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the
           LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be
           guilty;

03:004:028 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge:
           then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female
           without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.

03:004:029 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
           and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

03:004:030 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his
           finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt
           offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the
           bottom of the altar.

03:004:031 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is
           taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the
           priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto
           the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and
           it shall be forgiven him.

03:004:032 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
           female without blemish.

03:004:033 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
           and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill
           the burnt offering.

03:004:034 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
           with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
           burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at
           the bottom of the altar:

03:004:035 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the
           lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
           and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to
           the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall
           make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it
           shall be forgiven him.

03:005:001 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a
           witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not
           utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

03:005:002 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase
           of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the
           carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from
           him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.

03:005:003 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness
           it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from
           him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

03:005:004 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or
           to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with
           an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then
           he shall be guilty in one of these.

03:005:005 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these
           things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that
           thing:

03:005:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his
           sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a
           kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall
           make an atonement for him concerning his sin.

03:005:007 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for
           his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two
           young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the
           other for a burnt offering.

03:005:008 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that
           which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head
           from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:

03:005:009 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon
           the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be
           wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.

03:005:010 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according
           to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
           for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven
           him.

03:005:011 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
           pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the
           tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he
           shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any
           frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.

03:005:012 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall
           take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it
           on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the
           LORD: it is a sin offering.

03:005:013 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
           sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be
           forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat
           offering.

03:005:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:005:015 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the
           holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass
           unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with
           thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the
           sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

03:005:016 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
           holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it
           unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for
           him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be
           forgiven him.

03:005:017 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
           forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though
           he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

03:005:018 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock,
           with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
           and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his
           ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be
           forgiven him.

03:005:019 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed
           against the LORD.

03:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:002 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie
           unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or
           in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath
           deceived his neighbour;

03:006:003 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it,
           and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth,
           sinning therein:

03:006:004 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that
           he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the
           thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was
           delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,

03:006:005 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even
           restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more
           thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the
           day of his trespass offering.

03:006:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
           without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a
           trespass offering, unto the priest:

03:006:007 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the
           LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that
           he hath done in trespassing therein.

03:006:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:009 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the
           burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the
           burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the
           fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

03:006:010 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
           breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes
           which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the
           altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.

03:006:011 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,
           and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

03:006:012 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall
           not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every
           morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he
           shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.

03:006:013 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never
           go out.

03:006:014 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron
           shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

03:006:015 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
           offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense
           which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the
           altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the
           LORD.

03:006:016 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
           unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the
           court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

03:006:017 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them
           for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most
           holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

03:006:018 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It
           shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
           offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth
           them shall be holy.

03:006:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:020 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they
           shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the
           tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering
           perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at
           night.

03:006:021 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
           shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering
           shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:006:022 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
           offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be
           wholly burnt.

03:006:023 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt:
           it shall not be eaten.

03:006:024 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:025 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of
           the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is
           killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is
           most holy.

03:006:026 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
           place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

03:006:027 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and
           when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment,
           thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy
           place.

03:006:028 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken:
           and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured,
           and rinsed in water.

03:006:029 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
           holy.

03:006:030 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into
           the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the
           holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

03:007:001 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
           holy.

03:007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they
           kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he
           sprinkle round about upon the altar.

03:007:003 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and
           the fat that covereth the inwards,

03:007:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
           the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the
           kidneys, it shall he take away:

03:007:005 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering
           made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

03:007:006 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be
           eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.

03:007:007 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is
           one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith
           shall have it.

03:007:008 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even
           the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt
           offering which he hath offered.

03:007:009 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all
           that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the
           priest's that offereth it.

03:007:010 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all
           the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

03:007:011 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
           he shall offer unto the LORD.

03:007:012 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with
           the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with
           oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes
           mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

03:007:013 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened
           bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace
           offerings.

03:007:014 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
           heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's
           that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

03:007:015 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
           thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;
           he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

03:007:016 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
           offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
           sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be
           eaten:

03:007:017 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third
           day shall be burnt with fire.

03:007:018 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
           offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be
           accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth
           it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it
           shall bear his iniquity.

03:007:019 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be
           eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all
           that be clean shall eat thereof.

03:007:020 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of
           peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his
           uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his
           people.

03:007:021 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
           uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable
           unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
           offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall
           be cut off from his people.

03:007:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:007:023 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no
           manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

03:007:024 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
           that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use:
           but ye shall in no wise eat of it.

03:007:025 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer
           an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that
           eateth it shall be cut off from his people.

03:007:026 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of
           fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

03:007:027 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even
           that soul shall be cut off from his people.

03:007:028 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:007:029 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth
           the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring
           his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace
           offerings.

03:007:030 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by
           fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the
           breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

03:007:031 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the
           breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

03:007:032 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an
           heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

03:007:033 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the
           peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder
           for his part.

03:007:034 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
           children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace
           offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto
           his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of
           Israel.

03:007:035 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
           anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made
           by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto
           the LORD in the priest's office;

03:007:036 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of
           Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for
           ever throughout their generations.

03:007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering,
           and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of
           the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace
           offerings;

03:007:038 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that
           he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations
           unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

03:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:008:002 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
           anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two
           rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;

03:008:003 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:008:004 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was
           gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

03:008:005 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which
           the LORD commanded to be done.

03:008:006 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
           water.

03:008:007 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,
           and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and
           he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound
           it unto him therewith.

03:008:008 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
           breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

03:008:009 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even
           upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy
           crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:010 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle
           and all that was therein, and sanctified them.

03:008:011 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and
           anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his
           foot, to sanctify them.

03:008:012 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and
           anointed him, to sanctify him.

03:008:013 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and
           girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the
           LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:014 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and
           his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the
           sin offering.

03:008:015 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
           horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified
           the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar,
           and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.

03:008:016 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the
           caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and
           Moses burned it upon the altar.

03:008:017 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he
           burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:018 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and
           his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

03:008:019 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
           round about.

03:008:020 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and
           the pieces, and the fat.

03:008:021 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses
           burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice
           for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the
           LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:022 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and
           Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

03:008:023 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it
           upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his
           right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

03:008:024 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon
           the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right
           hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses
           sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

03:008:025 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was
           upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two
           kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:

03:008:026 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the
           LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread,
           and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right
           shoulder:

03:008:027 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands,
           and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.

03:008:028 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on
           the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for
           a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

03:008:029 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
           before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses'
           part; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:030 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which
           was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his
           garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with
           him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and
           his sons' garments with him.

03:008:031 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at
           the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat
           it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I
           commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

03:008:032 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall
           ye burn with fire.

03:008:033 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation in seven days, until the days of your
           consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate
           you.

03:008:034 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
           make an atonement for you.

03:008:035 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of
           the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

03:008:036 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded
           by the hand of Moses.

03:009:001 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron
           and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

03:009:002 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin
           offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and
           offer them before the LORD.

03:009:003 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take
           ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a
           lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt
           offering;

03:009:004 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
           before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to
           day the LORD will appear unto you.

03:009:005 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the
           tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew
           near and stood before the LORD.

03:009:006 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded
           that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto
           you.

03:009:007 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy
           sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement
           for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the
           people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

03:009:008 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the
           sin offering, which was for himself.

03:009:009 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he
           dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of
           the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the
           altar:

03:009:010 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of
           the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

03:009:011 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the
           camp.

03:009:012 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented
           unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the
           altar.

03:009:013 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the
           pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the
           altar.

03:009:014 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon
           the burnt offering on the altar.

03:009:015 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which
           was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered
           it for sin, as the first.

03:009:016 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
           the manner.

03:009:017 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
           and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the
           morning.

03:009:018 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
           offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons
           presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the
           altar round about,

03:009:019 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that
           which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul
           above the liver:

03:009:020 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat
           upon the altar:

03:009:021 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave
           offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

03:009:022 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed
           them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the
           burnt offering, and peace offerings.

03:009:023 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the
           glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.

03:009:024 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed
           upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all
           the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

03:010:001 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them
           his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and
           offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them
           not.

03:010:002 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
           they died before the LORD.

03:010:003 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
           saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and
           before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his
           peace.

03:010:004 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
           uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your
           brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

03:010:005 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
           camp; as Moses had said.

03:010:006 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
           his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes;
           lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let
           your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
           which the LORD hath kindled.

03:010:007 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD
           is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

03:010:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,

03:010:009 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with
           thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest
           ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
           generations:

03:010:010 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and
           between unclean and clean;

03:010:011 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes
           which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

03:010:012 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
           his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth
           of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without
           leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:

03:010:013 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due,
           and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire:
           for so I am commanded.

03:010:014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
           place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for
           they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the
           sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.

03:010:015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with
           the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave
           offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons'
           with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.

03:010:016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
           behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and
           Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,

03:010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy
           place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to
           bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for
           them before the LORD?

03:010:018 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy
           place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I
           commanded.

03:010:019 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
           their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD;
           and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin
           offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of
           the LORD?

03:010:020 And when Moses heard that, he was content.

03:011:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

03:011:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the
           beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the
           earth.

03:011:003 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth
           the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

03:011:004 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud,
           or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he
           cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto
           you.

03:011:005 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not
           the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

03:011:006 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
           hoof; he is unclean unto you.

03:011:007 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
           yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

03:011:008 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye
           not touch; they are unclean to you.

03:011:009 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever
           hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the
           rivers, them shall ye eat.

03:011:010 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
           rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living
           thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination
           unto you:

03:011:011 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat
           of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in
           abomination.

03:011:012 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall
           be an abomination unto you.

03:011:013 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among
           the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination:
           the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

03:011:014 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

03:011:015 Every raven after his kind;

03:011:016 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
           after his kind,

03:011:017 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

03:011:018 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

03:011:019 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and
           the bat.

03:011:020 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
           abomination unto you.

03:011:021 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
           upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap
           withal upon the earth;

03:011:022 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and
           the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind,
           and the grasshopper after his kind.

03:011:023 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
           shall be an abomination unto you.

03:011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
           carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

03:011:025 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
           his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

03:011:026 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is
           not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you:
           every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

03:011:027 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
           that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso
           toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

03:011:028 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his
           clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto
           you.

03:011:029 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
           that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the
           tortoise after his kind,

03:011:030 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the
           snail, and the mole.

03:011:031 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth
           touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the
           even.

03:011:032 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth
           fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood,
           or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein
           any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be
           unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

03:011:033 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,
           whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

03:011:034 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water
           cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in
           every such vessel shall be unclean.

03:011:035 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
           shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they
           shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be
           unclean unto you.

03:011:036 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
           water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase
           shall be unclean.

03:011:037 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed
           which is to be sown, it shall be clean.

03:011:038 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
           carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

03:011:039 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth
           the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

03:011:040 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his
           clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth
           the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
           the even.

03:011:041 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
           an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

03:011:042 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
           four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things
           that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are
           an abomination.

03:011:043 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping
           thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean
           with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

03:011:044 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
           yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall
           ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that
           creepeth upon the earth.

03:011:045 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of
           Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am
           holy.

03:011:046 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
           living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every
           creature that creepeth upon the earth:

03:011:047 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and
           between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not
           be eaten.

03:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:012:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have
           conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be
           unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation
           for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

03:012:003 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
           circumcised.

03:012:004 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying
           three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor
           come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be
           fulfilled.

03:012:005 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
           weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the
           blood of her purifying threescore and six days.

03:012:006 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son,
           or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year
           for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for
           a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, unto the priest:

03:012:007 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for
           her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.
           This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

03:012:008 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring
           two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt
           offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest
           shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.

03:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

03:013:002 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a
           scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like
           the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the
           priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:

03:013:003 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the
           flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and
           the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it
           is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and
           pronounce him unclean.

03:013:004 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
           sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not
           turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the
           plague seven days:

03:013:005 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold,
           if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread
           not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
           more:

03:013:006 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
           behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread
           not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is
           but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

03:013:007 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
           hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be
           seen of the priest again.

03:013:008 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
           skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
           leprosy.

03:013:009 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be
           brought unto the priest;

03:013:010 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be
           white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and
           there be quick raw flesh in the rising;

03:013:011 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest
           shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he
           is unclean.

03:013:012 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
           cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head
           even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

03:013:013 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy
           have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that
           hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.

03:013:014 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

03:013:015 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to
           be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

03:013:016 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
           shall come unto the priest;

03:013:017 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be
           turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean
           that hath the plague: he is clean.

03:013:018 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a
           boil, and is healed,

03:013:019 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a
           bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to
           the priest;

03:013:020 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower
           than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the
           priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy
           broken out of the boil.

03:013:021 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
           hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be
           somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

03:013:022 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest
           shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

03:013:023 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it
           is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

03:013:024 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
           burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright
           spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

03:013:025 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair
           in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper
           than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning:
           wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the
           plague of leprosy.

03:013:026 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
           hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other
           skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up
           seven days:

03:013:027 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it
           be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
           pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

03:013:028 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in
           the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the
           burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is
           an inflammation of the burning.

03:013:029 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

03:013:030 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in
           sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin
           hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry
           scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.

03:013:031 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and,
           behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that
           there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up
           him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:

03:013:032 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:
           and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no
           yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the
           skin;

03:013:033 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the
           priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

03:013:034 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:
           and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in
           sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce
           him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

03:013:035 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

03:013:036 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall
           be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow
           hair; he is unclean.

03:013:037 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is
           black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean:
           and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

03:013:038 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh
           bright spots, even white bright spots;

03:013:039 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots
           in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled
           spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.

03:013:040 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
           is he clean.

03:013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
           toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

03:013:042 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
           reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or
           his bald forehead.

03:013:043 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising
           of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald
           forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

03:013:044 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce
           him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

03:013:045 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be
           rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his
           upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

03:013:046 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
           defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp
           shall his habitation be.

03:013:047 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it
           be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

03:013:048 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;
           whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

03:013:049 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in
           the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing
           of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto
           the priest:

03:013:050 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that
           hath the plague seven days:

03:013:051 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the
           plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
           woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the
           plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

03:013:052 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
           woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague
           is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the
           fire.

03:013:053 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
           spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or
           in any thing of skin;

03:013:054 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein
           the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

03:013:055 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
           washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his
           colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou
           shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be
           bare within or without.

03:013:056 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat
           dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the
           garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the
           woof:

03:013:057 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or
           in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading
           plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

03:013:058 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
           skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed
           from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall
           be clean.

03:013:059 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
           woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of
           skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

03:014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:014:002 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his
           cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:

03:014:003 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest
           shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in
           the leper;

03:014:004 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be
           cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and
           scarlet, and hyssop:

03:014:005 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed
           in an earthen vessel over running water:

03:014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,
           and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the
           living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the
           running water:

03:014:007 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the
           leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall
           let the living bird loose into the open field.

03:014:008 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and
           shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may
           be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and
           shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

03:014:009 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all
           his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all
           his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes,
           also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

03:014:010 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
           blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish,
           and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering,
           mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

03:014:011 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man
           that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD,
           at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

03:014:012 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a
           trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a
           wave offering before the LORD:

03:014:013 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill
           the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place:
           for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass
           offering: it is most holy:

03:014:014 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
           offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the
           right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of
           his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

03:014:015 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it
           into the palm of his own left hand:

03:014:016 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is
           in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his
           finger seven times before the LORD:

03:014:017 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the
           priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
           cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
           great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass
           offering:

03:014:018 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he
           shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and
           the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.

03:014:019 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an
           atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness;
           and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:

03:014:020 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat
           offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an
           atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

03:014:021 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take
           one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an
           atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled
           with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;

03:014:022 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able
           to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a
           burnt offering.

03:014:023 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing
           unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, before the LORD.

03:014:024 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering,
           and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave
           offering before the LORD:

03:014:025 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the
           priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering,
           and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
           cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
           great toe of his right foot:

03:014:026 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own
           left hand:

03:014:027 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of
           the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:

03:014:028 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon
           the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and
           upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of
           his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass
           offering:

03:014:029 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall
           put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an
           atonement for him before the LORD.

03:014:030 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
           pigeons, such as he can get;

03:014:031 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering,
           and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering:
           and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be
           cleansed before the LORD.

03:014:032 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose
           hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his
           cleansing.

03:014:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

03:014:034 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you
           for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house
           of the land of your possession;

03:014:035 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest,
           saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the
           house:

03:014:036 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house,
           before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that
           is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest
           shall go in to see the house:

03:014:037 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be
           in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or
           reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

03:014:038 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
           house, and shut up the house seven days:

03:014:039 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall
           look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the
           house;

03:014:040 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones
           in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an
           unclean place without the city:

03:014:041 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about,
           and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without
           the city into an unclean place:

03:014:042 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of
           those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall
           plaister the house.

03:014:043 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house,
           after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath
           scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

03:014:044 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the
           plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the
           house; it is unclean.

03:014:045 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the
           timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall
           carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

03:014:046 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
           shut up shall be unclean until the even.

03:014:047 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he
           that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

03:014:048 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and,
           behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the
           house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the
           house clean, because the plague is healed.

03:014:049 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
           wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

03:014:050 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel
           over running water:

03:014:051 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the
           scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the
           slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house
           seven times:

03:014:052 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and
           with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the
           cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

03:014:053 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the
           open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall
           be clean.

03:014:054 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and
           scall,

03:014:055 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

03:014:056 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

03:014:057 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the
           law of leprosy.

03:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

03:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any
           man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his
           issue he is unclean.

03:015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his
           flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his
           issue, it is his uncleanness.

03:015:004 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean:
           and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

03:015:005 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

03:015:006 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the
           issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
           be unclean until the even.

03:015:007 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue
           shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
           unclean until the even.

03:015:008 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean;
           then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
           and be unclean until the even.

03:015:009 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue
           shall be unclean.

03:015:010 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be
           unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those
           things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
           be unclean until the even.

03:015:011 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not
           rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

03:015:012 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the
           issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be
           rinsed in water.

03:015:013 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then
           he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and
           wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and
           shall be clean.

03:015:014 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or
           two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the
           priest:

03:015:015 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering,
           and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make
           an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.

03:015:016 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he
           shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the
           even.

03:015:017 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
           copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until
           the even.

03:015:018 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of
           copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be
           unclean until the even.

03:015:019 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
           blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever
           toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.

03:015:020 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
           unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be
           unclean.

03:015:021 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

03:015:022 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
           his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until
           the even.

03:015:023 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,
           when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

03:015:024 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon
           him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon
           he lieth shall be unclean.

03:015:025 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
           time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her
           separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall
           be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.

03:015:026 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
           unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she
           sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her
           separation.

03:015:027 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and
           shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
           unclean until the even.

03:015:028 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
           herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

03:015:029 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or
           two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door
           of the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:015:030 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
           other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an
           atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her
           uncleanness.

03:015:031 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
           uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they
           defile my tabernacle that is among them.

03:015:032 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose
           seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

03:015:033 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath
           an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth
           with her that is unclean.

03:016:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons
           of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

03:016:002 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother,
           that he come not at all times into the holy place within the
           vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die
           not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

03:016:003 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young
           bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

03:016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the
           linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a
           linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired:
           these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in
           water, and so put them on.

03:016:005 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of
           Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram
           for a burnt offering.

03:016:006 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which
           is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his
           house.

03:016:007 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the
           LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:016:008 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
           LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

03:016:009 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,
           and offer him for a sin offering.

03:016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
           be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with
           him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

03:016:011 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which
           is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and
           for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering
           which is for himself:

03:016:012 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from
           off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet
           incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:

03:016:013 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD,
           that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is
           upon the testimony, that he die not:

03:016:014 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it
           with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the
           mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger
           seven times.

03:016:015 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for
           the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with
           that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and
           sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

03:016:016 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of
           the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of
           their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for
           the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them
           in the midst of their uncleanness.

03:016:017 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the
           congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy
           place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for
           himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation
           of Israel.

03:016:018 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD,
           and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of
           the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the
           horns of the altar round about.

03:016:019 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger
           seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the
           uncleanness of the children of Israel.

03:016:020 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place,
           and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he
           shall bring the live goat:

03:016:021 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
           goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
           of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,
           putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him
           away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:

03:016:022 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a
           land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the
           wilderness.

03:016:023 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
           and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he
           went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:

03:016:024 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and
           put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt
           offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an
           atonement for himself, and for the people.

03:016:025 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

03:016:026 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
           clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into
           the camp.

03:016:027 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
           offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the
           holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they
           shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their
           dung.

03:016:028 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
           flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

03:016:029 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
           seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict
           your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your
           own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:

03:016:030 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
           cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before
           the LORD.

03:016:031 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
           your souls, by a statute for ever.

03:016:032 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
           consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's
           stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen
           clothes, even the holy garments:

03:016:033 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he
           shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an
           atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
           congregation.

03:016:034 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
           atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a
           year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:017:002 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children
           of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD
           hath commanded, saying,

03:017:003 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth
           an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out
           of the camp,

03:017:004 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the
           tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man;
           he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among
           his people:

03:017:005 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their
           sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they
           may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace
           offerings unto the LORD.

03:017:006 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
           LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and
           burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:017:007 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils,
           after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute
           for ever unto them throughout their generations.

03:017:008 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the
           house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you,
           that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,

03:017:009 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall
           be cut off from among his people.

03:017:010 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
           strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of
           blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth
           blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

03:017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it
           to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for
           it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

03:017:012 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you
           shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth
           among you eat blood.

03:017:013 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of
           the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and
           catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even
           pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

03:017:014 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the
           life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye
           shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all
           flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut
           off.

03:017:015 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that
           which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own
           country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then
           shall he be clean.

03:017:016 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall
           bear his iniquity.

03:018:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:018:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the
           LORD your God.

03:018:003 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall
           ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither
           I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their
           ordinances.

03:018:004 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
           therein: I am the LORD your God.

03:018:005 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which
           if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.

03:018:006 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him,
           to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

03:018:007 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
           shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not
           uncover her nakedness.

03:018:008 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it
           is thy father's nakedness.

03:018:009 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
           daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born
           abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

03:018:010 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's
           daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for
           theirs is thine own nakedness.

03:018:011 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
           father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her
           nakedness.

03:018:012 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister:
           she is thy father's near kinswoman.

03:018:013 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister:
           for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

03:018:014 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,
           thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

03:018:015 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law:
           she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

03:018:016 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it
           is thy brother's nakedness.

03:018:017 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her
           daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her
           daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are
           her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.

03:018:018 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to
           uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

03:018:019 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her
           nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

03:018:020 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's
           wife, to defile thyself with her.

03:018:021 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire
           to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I
           am the LORD.

03:018:022 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
           abomination.

03:018:023 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
           therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie
           down thereto: it is confusion.

03:018:024 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all
           these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

03:018:025 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity
           thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her
           inhabitants.

03:018:026 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and
           shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of
           your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:

03:018:027 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done,
           which were before you, and the land is defiled;)

03:018:028 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it
           spued out the nations that were before you.

03:018:029 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the
           souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their
           people.

03:018:030 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any
           one of these abominable customs, which were committed before
           you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD
           your God.

03:019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:019:002 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and
           say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am
           holy.

03:019:003 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep
           my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:004 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I
           am the LORD your God.

03:019:005 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD,
           ye shall offer it at your own will.

03:019:006 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:
           and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in
           the fire.

03:019:007 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable;
           it shall not be accepted.

03:019:008 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
           because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and
           that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

03:019:009 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not
           wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou
           gather the gleanings of thy harvest.

03:019:010 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou
           gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for
           the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:011 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
           another.

03:019:012 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
           profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

03:019:013 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the
           wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night
           until the morning.

03:019:014 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
           the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.

03:019:015 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
           respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the
           mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

03:019:016 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy
           people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy
           neighbour; I am the LORD.

03:019:017 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in
           any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

03:019:018 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the
           children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as
           thyself: I am the LORD.

03:019:019 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle
           gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with
           mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and
           woollen come upon thee.

03:019:020 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
           betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom
           given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to
           death, because she was not free.

03:019:021 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto
           the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for
           a trespass offering.

03:019:022 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
           the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he
           hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven
           him.

03:019:023 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted
           all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit
           thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as
           uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.

03:019:024 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
           praise the LORD withal.

03:019:025 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that
           it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your
           God.

03:019:026 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye
           use enchantment, nor observe times.

03:019:027 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt
           thou mar the corners of thy beard.

03:019:028 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
           print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.

03:019:029 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore;
           lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of
           wickedness.

03:019:030 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
           the LORD.

03:019:031 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
           wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:032 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face
           of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

03:019:033 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
           vex him.

03:019:034 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as
           one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye
           were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:035 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
           weight, or in measure.

03:019:036 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin,
           shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out
           of the land of Egypt.

03:019:037 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
           judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.

03:020:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:020:002 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he
           be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn
           in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall
           surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him
           with stones.

03:020:003 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
           from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto
           Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

03:020:004 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
           the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him
           not:

03:020:005 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his
           family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after
           him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

03:020:006 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
           and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set
           my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his
           people.

03:020:007 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the
           LORD your God.

03:020:008 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD
           which sanctify you.

03:020:009 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
           surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother;
           his blood shall be upon him.

03:020:010 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,
           even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife,
           the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

03:020:011 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered
           his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to
           death; their blood shall be upon them.

03:020:012 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
           surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their
           blood shall be upon them.

03:020:013 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
           of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be
           put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

03:020:014 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness:
           they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be
           no wickedness among you.

03:020:015 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to
           death: and ye shall slay the beast.

03:020:016 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
           thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be
           put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

03:020:017 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or
           his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his
           nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in
           the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's
           nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

03:020:018 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
           shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain,
           and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of
           them shall be cut off from among their people.

03:020:019 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's
           sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near
           kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

03:020:020 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath
           uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin;
           they shall die childless.

03:020:021 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean
           thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall
           be childless.

03:020:022 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
           and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell
           therein, spue you not out.

03:020:023 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I
           cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and
           therefore I abhorred them.

03:020:024 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
           will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with
           milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated
           you from other people.

03:020:025 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
           unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not
           make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any
           manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I
           have separated from you as unclean.

03:020:026 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
           severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

03:020:027 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
           wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them
           with stones: their blood shall be upon them.

03:021:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons
           of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for
           the dead among his people:

03:021:002 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his
           mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his
           daughter, and for his brother.

03:021:003 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath
           had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

03:021:004 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his
           people, to profane himself.

03:021:005 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall
           they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any
           cuttings in their flesh.

03:021:006 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
           their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the
           bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be
           holy.

03:021:007 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane;
           neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for
           he is holy unto his God.

03:021:008 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread
           of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which
           sanctify you, am holy.

03:021:009 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by
           playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be
           burnt with fire.

03:021:010 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
           head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to
           put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his
           clothes;

03:021:011 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself
           for his father, or for his mother;

03:021:012 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the
           sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of
           his God is upon him: I am the LORD.

03:021:013 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

03:021:014 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these
           shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own
           people to wife.

03:021:015 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the
           LORD do sanctify him.

03:021:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:021:017 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
           generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to
           offer the bread of his God.

03:021:018 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
           approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose,
           or any thing superfluous,

03:021:019 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

03:021:020 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye,
           or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

03:021:021 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest
           shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by
           fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the
           bread of his God.

03:021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and
           of the holy.

03:021:023 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
           altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my
           sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

03:021:024 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all
           the children of Israel.

03:022:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:022:002 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate
           themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and
           that they profane not my holy name in those things which they
           hallow unto me: I am the LORD.

03:022:003 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
           generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the
           children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his
           uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my
           presence: I am the LORD.

03:022:004 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a
           running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he
           be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the
           dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

03:022:005 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be
           made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,
           whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

03:022:006 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until
           even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his
           flesh with water.

03:022:007 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall
           afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

03:022:008 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall
           not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.

03:022:009 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin
           for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do
           sanctify them.

03:022:010 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
           the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy
           thing.

03:022:011 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
           it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his
           meat.

03:022:012 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
           may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

03:022:013 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
           no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her
           youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be
           no stranger eat thereof.

03:022:014 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
           put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the
           priest with the holy thing.

03:022:015 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
           Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

03:022:016 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat
           their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

03:022:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:022:018 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children
           of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of
           Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his
           oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings,
           which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;

03:022:019 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the
           beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

03:022:020 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
           shall not be acceptable for you.

03:022:021 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
           LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves
           or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be
           no blemish therein.

03:022:022 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
           scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an
           offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

03:022:023 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
           lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill
           offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

03:022:024 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or
           crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering
           thereof in your land.

03:022:025 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of
           your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them,
           and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

03:022:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:022:027 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then
           it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day
           and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by
           fire unto the LORD.

03:022:028 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
           young both in one day.

03:022:029 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
           LORD, offer it at your own will.

03:022:030 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of
           it until the morrow: I am the LORD.

03:022:031 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the
           LORD.

03:022:032 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed
           among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,

03:022:033 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I
           am the LORD.

03:023:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
           Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
           be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.

03:023:003 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the
           sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work
           therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

03:023:004 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations,
           which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

03:023:005 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's
           passover.

03:023:006 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
           unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat
           unleavened bread.

03:023:007 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall
           do no servile work therein.

03:023:008 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
           seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye
           shall do no servile work therein.

03:023:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap
           the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the
           firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:

03:023:011 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted
           for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave
           it.

03:023:012 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
           without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto
           the LORD.

03:023:013 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
           flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD
           for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of
           wine, the fourth part of an hin.

03:023:014 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
           ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering
           unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
           generations in all your dwellings.

03:023:015 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
           from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;
           seven sabbaths shall be complete:

03:023:016 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number
           fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the
           LORD.

03:023:017 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two
           tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken
           with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

03:023:018 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish
           of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they
           shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat
           offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by
           fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin
           offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of
           peace offerings.

03:023:020 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the
           firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two
           lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.

03:023:021 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an
           holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work
           therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings
           throughout your generations.

03:023:022 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
           clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest,
           neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou
           shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the
           LORD your God.

03:023:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:024 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh
           month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath,
           a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.

03:023:025 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD.

03:023:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:027 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a
           day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you;
           and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by
           fire unto the LORD.

03:023:028 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
           atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your
           God.

03:023:029 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
           same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

03:023:030 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same
           day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

03:023:031 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
           throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

03:023:032 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
           your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even
           unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

03:023:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:034 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day
           of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for
           seven days unto the LORD.

03:023:035 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
           servile work therein.

03:023:036 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the
           LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you;
           and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it
           is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.

03:023:037 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
           be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto
           the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice,
           and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:

03:023:038 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and
           beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings,
           which ye give unto the LORD.

03:023:039 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
           gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto
           the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and
           on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.

03:023:040 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly
           trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,
           and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD
           your God seven days.

03:023:041 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the
           year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye
           shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

03:023:042 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites
           born shall dwell in booths:

03:023:043 That your generations may know that I made the children of
           Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land
           of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

03:023:044 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of
           the LORD.

03:024:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:024:002 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure
           oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn
           continually.

03:024:003 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the
           morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for
           ever in your generations.

03:024:004 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
           LORD continually.

03:024:005 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:
           two tenth deals shall be in one cake.

03:024:006 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the
           pure table before the LORD.

03:024:007 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it
           may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by
           fire unto the LORD.

03:024:008 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD
           continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an
           everlasting covenant.

03:024:009 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it
           in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the
           offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.

03:024:010 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an
           Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son
           of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together
           in the camp;

03:024:011 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the
           Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his
           mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the
           tribe of Dan:)

03:024:012 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be
           shewed them.

03:024:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:024:014 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all
           that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the
           congregation stone him.

03:024:015 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
           Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

03:024:016 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely
           be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly
           stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the
           land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put
           to death.

03:024:017 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

03:024:018 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for
           beast.

03:024:019 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath
           done, so shall it be done to him;

03:024:020 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath
           caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.

03:024:021 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
           killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

03:024:022 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
           for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.

03:024:023 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should
           bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him
           with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

03:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

03:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep
           a sabbath unto the LORD.

03:025:003 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
           prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

03:025:004 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the
           land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy
           field, nor prune thy vineyard.

03:025:005 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
           not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for
           it is a year of rest unto the land.

03:025:006 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee,
           and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired
           servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

03:025:007 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land,
           shall all the increase thereof be meat.

03:025:008 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
           times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of
           years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.

03:025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on
           the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement
           shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

03:025:010 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
           throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it
           shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto
           his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

03:025:011 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not
           sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor
           gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.

03:025:012 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
           the increase thereof out of the field.

03:025:013 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
           possession.

03:025:014 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
           thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

03:025:015 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt
           buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years
           of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:

03:025:016 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the
           price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou
           shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of
           the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

03:025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt
           fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God.

03:025:018 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and
           do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

03:025:019 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your
           fill, and dwell therein in safety.

03:025:020 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?
           behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

03:025:021 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year,
           and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

03:025:022 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit
           until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of
           the old store.

03:025:023 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for
           ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

03:025:024 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
           redemption for the land.

03:025:025 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
           possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then
           shall he redeem that which his brother sold.

03:025:026 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
           redeem it;

03:025:027 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore
           the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may
           return unto his possession.

03:025:028 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
           sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until
           the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he
           shall return unto his possession.

03:025:029 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he
           may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a
           full year may he redeem it.

03:025:030 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year,
           then the house that is in the walled city shall be established
           for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it
           shall not go out in the jubile.

03:025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
           them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may
           be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

03:025:032 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of
           the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any
           time.

03:025:033 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
           sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year
           of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are
           their possession among the children of Israel.

03:025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
           for it is their perpetual possession.

03:025:035 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with
           thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a
           stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.

03:025:036 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
           thy brother may live with thee.

03:025:037 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
           victuals for increase.

03:025:038 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
           land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your
           God.

03:025:039 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
           sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
           bondservant:

03:025:040 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
           thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

03:025:041 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
           with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
           possession of his fathers shall he return.

03:025:042 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the
           land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

03:025:043 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
           God.

03:025:044 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
           shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them
           shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

03:025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn
           among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that
           are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be
           your possession.

03:025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children
           after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be
           your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of
           Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.

03:025:047 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
           brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto
           the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the
           stranger's family:

03:025:048 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his
           brethren may redeem him:

03:025:049 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any
           that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or
           if he be able, he may redeem himself.

03:025:050 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year
           that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price
           of his sale shall be according unto the number of years,
           according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with
           him.

03:025:051 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he
           shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money
           that he was bought for.

03:025:052 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile,
           then he shall count with him, and according unto his years
           shall he give him again the price of his redemption.

03:025:053 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
           other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

03:025:054 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
           in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

03:025:055 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
           servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am
           the LORD your God.

03:026:001 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you
           up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of
           stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD
           your God.

03:026:002 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
           the LORD.

03:026:003 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do
           them;

03:026:004 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall
           yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield
           their fruit.

03:026:005 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the
           vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat
           your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

03:026:006 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
           none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of
           the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

03:026:007 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before
           you by the sword.

03:026:008 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
           shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall
           before you by the sword.

03:026:009 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
           multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

03:026:010 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
           the new.

03:026:011 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
           you.

03:026:012 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall
           be my people.

03:026:013 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
           land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have
           broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

03:026:014 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
           commandments;

03:026:015 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my
           judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but
           that ye break my covenant:

03:026:016 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you
           terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume
           the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your
           seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

03:026:017 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain
           before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you;
           and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.

03:026:018 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I
           will punish you seven times more for your sins.

03:026:019 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
           heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

03:026:020 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall
           not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land
           yield their fruits.

03:026:021 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me;
           I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to
           your sins.

03:026:022 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
           your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in
           number; and your high ways shall be desolate.

03:026:023 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
           walk contrary unto me;

03:026:024 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you
           yet seven times for your sins.

03:026:025 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the
           quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together
           within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and
           ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

03:026:026 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women
           shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you
           your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be
           satisfied.

03:026:027 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
           contrary unto me;

03:026:028 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even
           I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

03:026:029 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
           daughters shall ye eat.

03:026:030 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
           and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my
           soul shall abhor you.

03:026:031 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
           unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet
           odours.

03:026:032 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
           which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

03:026:033 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
           sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your
           cities waste.

03:026:034 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
           desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the
           land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

03:026:035 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
           rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

03:026:036 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a
           faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and
           the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall
           flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none
           pursueth.

03:026:037 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a
           sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand
           before your enemies.

03:026:038 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
           enemies shall eat you up.

03:026:039 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their
           iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of
           their fathers shall they pine away with them.

03:026:040 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of
           their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed
           against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;

03:026:041 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have
           brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their
           uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the
           punishment of their iniquity:

03:026:042 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my
           covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I
           remember; and I will remember the land.

03:026:043 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
           sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they
           shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because,
           even because they despised my judgments, and because their
           soul abhorred my statutes.

03:026:044 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their
           enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them,
           to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them:
           for I am the LORD their God.

03:026:045 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
           ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in
           the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the
           LORD.

03:026:046 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
           made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by
           the hand of Moses.

03:027:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:027:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a
           man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the
           LORD by thy estimation.

03:027:003 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
           even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty
           shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

03:027:004 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
           shekels.

03:027:005 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old,
           then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and
           for the female ten shekels.

03:027:006 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then
           thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver,
           and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of
           silver.

03:027:007 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
           then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the
           female ten shekels.

03:027:008 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
           himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him;
           according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value
           him.

03:027:009 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
           LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be
           holy.

03:027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a
           bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast,
           then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.

03:027:011 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
           sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast
           before the priest:

03:027:012 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as
           thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

03:027:013 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth
           part thereof unto thy estimation.

03:027:014 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
           LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or
           bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

03:027:015 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
           shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
           it, and it shall be his.

03:027:016 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
           of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to
           the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at
           fifty shekels of silver.

03:027:017 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
           thy estimation it shall stand.

03:027:018 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
           shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that
           remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be
           abated from thy estimation.

03:027:019 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem
           it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy
           estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.

03:027:020 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
           field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

03:027:021 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
           unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof
           shall be the priest's.

03:027:022 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
           bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;

03:027:023 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy
           estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall
           give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the
           LORD.

03:027:024 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
           whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the
           land did belong.

03:027:025 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of
           the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

03:027:026 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's
           firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or
           sheep: it is the LORD's.

03:027:027 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
           according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of
           it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold
           according to thy estimation.

03:027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
           the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of
           the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every
           devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.

03:027:029 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be
           redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.

03:027:030 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
           land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy
           unto the LORD.

03:027:031 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
           add thereto the fifth part thereof.

03:027:032 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
           whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto
           the LORD.

03:027:033 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall
           he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the
           change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

03:027:034 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for
           the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

Book 04        Numbers

04:001:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
           the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the
           second month, in the second year after they were come out of
           the land of Egypt, saying,

04:001:002 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of
           Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
           with the number of their names, every male by their polls;

04:001:003 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go
           forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by
           their armies.

04:001:004 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one
           head of the house of his fathers.

04:001:005 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you:
           of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.

04:001:006 Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

04:001:016 These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the
           tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.

04:001:017 And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by
           their names:

04:001:018 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first
           day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees
           after their families, by the house of their fathers, according
           to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
           by their polls.

04:001:019 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the
           wilderness of Sinai.

04:001:020 And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their
           generations, after their families, by the house of their
           fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls,
           every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were

04:001:038 Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their
           families, by the house of their fathers, according to the
           number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all
           that were able to go forth to war;

04:001:039 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan,
           were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

04:001:040 Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after their
           families, by the house of their fathers, according to the
           number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all
           that were able to go forth to war;

04:001:041 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Asher,
           were forty and one thousand and five hundred.

04:001:042 Of the children of Naphtali, throughout their generations,
           after their families, by the house of their fathers, according
           to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
           all that were able to go forth to war;

04:001:043 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
           Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.

04:001:044 These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron
           numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each
           one was for the house of his fathers.

04:001:045 So were all those that were numbered of the children of
           Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old
           and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;

04:001:046 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and
           three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

04:001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not
           numbered among them.

04:001:048 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,

04:001:049 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the
           sum of them among the children of Israel:

04:001:050 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of
           testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all
           things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and
           all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and
           shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

04:001:051 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall
           take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the
           Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh
           shall be put to death.

04:001:052 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man
           by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout
           their hosts.

04:001:053 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of
           testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the
           children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of
           the tabernacle of testimony.

04:001:054 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
           commanded Moses, so did they.

04:002:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:002:002 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own
           standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off
           about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.

04:002:003 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they
           of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their
           armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of
           the children of Judah.

04:002:004 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

04:002:005 And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of
           Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of
           the children of Issachar.

04:002:006 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
           and four thousand and four hundred.

04:002:007 Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall be
           captain of the children of Zebulun.

04:002:008 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
           and seven thousand and four hundred.

04:002:009 All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred
           thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four
           hundred, throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

04:002:010 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben
           according to their armies: and the captain of the children of
           Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

04:002:011 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty
           and six thousand and five hundred.

04:002:012 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and
           the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the
           son of Zurishaddai.

04:002:013 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
           and nine thousand and three hundred.

04:002:014 Then the tribe of Gad: and the captain of the sons of Gad
           shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

04:002:015 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
           and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.

04:002:016 All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred
           thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and
           fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in
           the second rank.

04:002:017 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with
           the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they
           encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by
           their standards.

04:002:018 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim
           according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of
           Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

04:002:019 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
           thousand and five hundred.

04:002:020 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the captain of
           the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of
           Pedahzur.

04:002:021 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

04:002:022 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of
           Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

04:002:023 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

04:002:024 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred
           thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their
           armies. And they shall go forward in the third rank.

04:002:025 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by
           their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be
           Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

04:002:026 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

04:002:027 And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher: and
           the captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son
           of Ocran.

04:002:028 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
           and one thousand and five hundred.

04:002:029 Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of
           Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.

04:002:030 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
           and three thousand and four hundred.

04:002:031 All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred
           thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They
           shall go hindmost with their standards.

04:002:032 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel
           by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of
           the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and
           three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

04:002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of
           Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

04:002:034 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
           commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so
           they set forward, every one after their families, according to
           the house of their fathers.

04:003:001 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day
           that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

04:003:002 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the
           firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

04:003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which
           were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's
           office.

04:003:004 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered
           strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and
           they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in
           the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.

04:003:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:003:006 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron
           the priest, that they may minister unto him.

04:003:007 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
           congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do
           the service of the tabernacle.

04:003:008 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of
           the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to
           do the service of the tabernacle.

04:003:009 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons:
           they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

04:003:010 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait
           on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh
           shall be put to death.

04:003:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:003:012 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the
           children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth
           the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites
           shall be mine;

04:003:013 Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I
           smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto
           me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall
           they be: I am the LORD.

04:003:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
           saying,

04:003:015 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers,
           by their families: every male from a month old and upward
           shalt thou number them.

04:003:016 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as
           he was commanded.

04:003:017 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and
           Kohath, and Merari.

04:003:018 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their
           families; Libni, and Shimei.

04:003:019 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar,
           Hebron, and Uzziel.

04:003:020 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi.
           These are the families of the Levites according to the house
           of their fathers.

04:003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of
           the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.

04:003:022 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of
           all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that
           were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.

04:003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the
           tabernacle westward.

04:003:024 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites
           shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

04:003:025 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the
           congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the
           covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation,

04:003:026 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of
           the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round
           about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.

04:003:027 And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family
           of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the
           family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the
           Kohathites.

04:003:028 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
           were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the
           sanctuary.

04:003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of
           the tabernacle southward.

04:003:030 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
           the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

04:003:031 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the
           candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary
           wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service
           thereof.

04:003:032 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over
           the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that
           keep the charge of the sanctuary.

04:003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of
           the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

04:003:034 And those that were numbered of them, according to the number
           of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six
           thousand and two hundred.

04:003:035 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
           Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the
           side of the tabernacle northward.

04:003:036 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall
           be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the
           pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels
           thereof, and all that serveth thereto,

04:003:037 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
           and their pins, and their cords.

04:003:038 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east,
           even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall
           be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the
           sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the
           stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

04:003:039 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron
           numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their
           families, all the males from a month old and upward, were
           twenty and two thousand.

04:003:040 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the
           males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,
           and take the number of their names.

04:003:041 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead
           of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the
           cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the
           cattle of the children of Israel.

04:003:042 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the
           firstborn among the children of Israel.

04:003:043 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a
           month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them,
           were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and
           thirteen.

04:003:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:003:045 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the
           children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of
           their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.

04:003:046 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
           threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of
           Israel, which are more than the Levites;

04:003:047 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after
           the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel
           is twenty gerahs:)

04:003:048 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of
           them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

04:003:049 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and
           above them that were redeemed by the Levites:

04:003:050 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money;
           a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels,
           after the shekel of the sanctuary:

04:003:051 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron
           and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the
           LORD commanded Moses.

04:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:004:002 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of
           Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,

04:004:003 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,
           all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle
           of the congregation.

04:004:004 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the
           tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:

04:004:005 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his
           sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover
           the ark of testimony with it:

04:004:006 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and
           shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in
           the staves thereof.

04:004:007 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of
           blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the
           bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread
           shall be thereon:

04:004:008 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover
           the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in
           the staves thereof.

04:004:009 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick
           of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his
           snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they
           minister unto it:

04:004:010 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a
           covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

04:004:011 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
           and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put
           to the staves thereof:

04:004:012 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith
           they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of
           blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and
           shall put them on a bar:

04:004:013 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread
           a purple cloth thereon:

04:004:014 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith
           they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and
           the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and
           they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and
           put to the staves of it.

04:004:015 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
           sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp
           is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come
           to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they
           die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the
           tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:016 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
           pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and
           the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the
           oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is,
           in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.

04:004:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,

04:004:018 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
           from among the Levites:

04:004:019 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when
           they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons
           shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to
           his burden:

04:004:020 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are
           covered, lest they die.

04:004:021 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:004:022 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the
           houses of their fathers, by their families;

04:004:023 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt
           thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to
           do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to
           serve, and for burdens:

04:004:025 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
           tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering
           of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging
           for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

04:004:026 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of
           the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the
           altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of
           their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they
           serve.

04:004:027 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
           service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens,
           and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in
           charge all their burdens.

04:004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in
           the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be
           under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

04:004:029 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
           families, by the house of their fathers;

04:004:030 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old
           shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the
           service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:031 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
           service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of
           the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof,
           and sockets thereof,

04:004:032 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
           and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,
           and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the
           instruments of the charge of their burden.

04:004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
           according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the
           priest.

04:004:034 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered
           the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the
           house of their fathers,

04:004:035 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
           tabernacle of the congregation:

04:004:036 And those that were numbered of them by their families were
           two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

04:004:037 These were they that were numbered of the families of the
           Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to
           the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

04:004:038 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon,
           throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,

04:004:039 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
           tabernacle of the congregation,

04:004:040 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their
           families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and
           six hundred and thirty.

04:004:041 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons
           of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of
           the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to
           the commandment of the LORD.

04:004:042 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
           Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their
           fathers,

04:004:043 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
           tabernacle of the congregation,

04:004:044 Even those that were numbered of them after their families,
           were three thousand and two hundred.

04:004:045 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons
           of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word
           of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

04:004:046 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and
           Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families,
           and after the house of their fathers,

04:004:047 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the
           service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:048 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and
           five hundred and fourscore,

04:004:049 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by
           the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and
           according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as
           the LORD commanded Moses.

04:005:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:005:002 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp
           every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever
           is defiled by the dead:

04:005:003 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall
           ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst
           whereof I dwell.

04:005:004 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without
           the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of
           Israel.

04:005:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:005:006 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
           commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the
           LORD, and that person be guilty;

04:005:007 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he
           shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and
           add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him
           against whom he hath trespassed.

04:005:008 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass
           unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to
           the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an
           atonement shall be made for him.

04:005:009 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of
           Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

04:005:010 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any
           man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

04:005:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:005:012 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
           man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,

04:005:013 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes
           of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and
           there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the
           manner;

04:005:014 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of
           his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy
           come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not
           defiled:

04:005:015 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he
           shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah
           of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put
           frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an
           offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

04:005:016 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the
           LORD:

04:005:017 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and
           of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest
           shall take, and put it into the water:

04:005:018 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and
           uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in
           her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest
           shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the
           curse:

04:005:019 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the
           woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not
           gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband,
           be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:

04:005:020 But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband,
           and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
           beside thine husband:

04:005:021 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of
           cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD
           make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD
           doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;

04:005:022 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy
           bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And
           the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

04:005:023 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he
           shall blot them out with the bitter water:

04:005:024 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that
           causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall
           enter into her, and become bitter.

04:005:025 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
           woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and
           offer it upon the altar:

04:005:026 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the
           memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward
           shall cause the woman to drink the water.

04:005:027 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall
           come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass
           against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse
           shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall
           swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse
           among her people.

04:005:028 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall
           be free, and shall conceive seed.

04:005:029 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to
           another instead of her husband, and is defiled;

04:005:030 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be
           jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the
