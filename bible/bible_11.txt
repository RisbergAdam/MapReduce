           their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten
           them.

24:019:010 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that
           go with thee,

24:019:011 And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so
           will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a
           potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they
           shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.

24:019:012 Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the
           inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:

24:019:013 And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of
           Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all
           the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all
           the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto
           other gods.

24:019:014 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him
           to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house;
           and said to all the people,

24:019:015 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
           will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil
           that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened
           their necks, that they might not hear my words.

24:020:001 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief
           governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah
           prophesied these things.

24:020:002 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the
           stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by
           the house of the LORD.

24:020:003 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth
           Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The
           LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.

24:020:004 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to
           thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the
           sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I
           will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and
           he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them
           with the sword.

24:020:005 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all
           the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and
           all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the
           hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them,
           and carry them to Babylon.

24:020:006 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go
           into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou
           shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy
           friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.

24:020:007 O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art
           stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily,
           every one mocketh me.

24:020:008 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil;
           because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and
           a derision, daily.

24:020:009 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any
           more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning
           fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and
           I could not stay.

24:020:010 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report,
           say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for
           my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we
           shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on
           him.

24:020:011 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my
           persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they
           shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their
           everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.

24:020:012 But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the
           reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for
           unto thee have I opened my cause.

24:020:013 Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered
           the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.

24:020:014 Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein
           my mother bare me be blessed.

24:020:015 Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A
           man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.

24:020:016 And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew,
           and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and
           the shouting at noontide;

24:020:017 Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might
           have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.

24:020:018 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and
           sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

24:021:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king
           Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and
           Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,

24:021:002 Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar
           king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD
           will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he
           may go up from us.

24:021:003 Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:

24:021:004 Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back
           the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight
           against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which
           besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into
           the midst of this city.

24:021:005 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand
           and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in
           great wrath.

24:021:006 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and
           beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.

24:021:007 And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of
           Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left
           in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the
           famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and
           into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those
           that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of
           the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor
           have mercy.

24:021:008 And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD;
           Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of
           death.

24:021:009 He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by
           the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and
           falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and
           his life shall be unto him for a prey.

24:021:010 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for
           good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the
           king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.

24:021:011 And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the
           word of the LORD;

24:021:012 O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the
           morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of
           the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that
           none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

24:021:013 Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and
           rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come
           down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?

24:021:014 But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,
           saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest
           thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.

24:022:001 Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of
           Judah, and speak there this word,

24:022:002 And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that
           sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and
           thy people that enter in by these gates:

24:022:003 Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness,
           and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and
           do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless,
           nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.

24:022:004 For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by
           the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of
           David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants,
           and his people.

24:022:005 But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith
           the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.

24:022:006 For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou
           art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will
           make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.

24:022:007 And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his
           weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast
           them into the fire.

24:022:008 And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say
           every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus
           unto this great city?

24:022:009 Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the
           covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and
           served them.

24:022:010 Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore
           for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see
           his native country.

24:022:011 For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah
           king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father,
           which went forth out of this place; He shall not return
           thither any more:

24:022:012 But he shall die in the place whither they have led him
           captive, and shall see this land no more.

24:022:013 Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and
           his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service
           without wages, and giveth him not for his work;

24:022:014 That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers,
           and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and
           painted with vermilion.

24:022:015 Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did
           not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and
           then it was well with him?

24:022:016 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well
           with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD.

24:022:017 But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy
           covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for
           oppression, and for violence, to do it.

24:022:018 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of
           Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying,
           Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him,
           saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!

24:022:019 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast
           forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

24:022:020 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan,
           and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.

24:022:021 I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will
           not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou
           obeyedst not my voice.

24:022:022 The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go
           into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and
           confounded for all thy wickedness.

24:022:023 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars,
           how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain
           as of a woman in travail!

24:022:024 As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim
           king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I
           pluck thee thence;

24:022:025 And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life,
           and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into
           the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand
           of the Chaldeans.

24:022:026 And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into
           another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye
           die.

24:022:027 But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall
           they not return.

24:022:028 Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel
           wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and
           his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?

24:022:029 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.

24:022:030 Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that
           shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall
           prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more
           in Judah.

24:023:001 Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of
           my pasture! saith the LORD.

24:023:002 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the
           pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and
           driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will
           visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.

24:023:003 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
           whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their
           folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.

24:023:004 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them:
           and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall
           they be lacking, saith the LORD.

24:023:005 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto
           David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper,
           and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.

24:023:006 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell
           safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE
           LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.

24:023:007 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they
           shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the
           children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

24:023:008 But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed
           of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all
           countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in
           their own land.

24:023:009 Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my
           bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine
           hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words
           of his holiness.

24:023:010 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing
           the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are
           dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not
           right.

24:023:011 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have
           I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.

24:023:012 Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the
           darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I
           will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation,
           saith the LORD.

24:023:013 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they
           prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.

24:023:014 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible
           thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen
           also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his
           wickedness; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the
           inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.

24:023:015 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the
           prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make
           them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of
           Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.

24:023:016 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of
           the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they
           speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of
           the LORD.

24:023:017 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said,
           Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh
           after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come
           upon you.

24:023:018 For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath
           perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and
           heard it?

24:023:019 Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a
           grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of
           the wicked.

24:023:020 The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have
           executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his
           heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.

24:023:021 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not
           spoken to them, yet they prophesied.

24:023:022 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people
           to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their
           evil way, and from the evil of their doings.

24:023:023 Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?

24:023:024 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see
           him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the
           LORD.

24:023:025 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my
           name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.

24:023:026 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that
           prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their
           own heart;

24:023:027 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their
           dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their
           fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.

24:023:028 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he
           that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is
           the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.

24:023:029 Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a
           hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?

24:023:030 Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD,
           that steal my words every one from his neighbour.

24:023:031 Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use
           their tongues, and say, He saith.

24:023:032 Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith
           the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by
           their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor
           commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at
           all, saith the LORD.

24:023:033 And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask
           thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then
           say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the
           LORD.

24:023:034 And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that
           shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man
           and his house.

24:023:035 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to
           his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the
           LORD spoken?

24:023:036 And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every
           man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the
           words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.

24:023:037 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD
           answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?

24:023:038 But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith
           the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD,
           and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden
           of the LORD;

24:023:039 Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I
           will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your
           fathers, and cast you out of my presence:

24:023:040 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a
           perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

24:024:001 The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set
           before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king
           of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of
           Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the
           carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to
           Babylon.

24:024:002 One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are
           first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which
           could not be eaten, they were so bad.

24:024:003 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
           said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil,
           that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

24:024:004 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

24:024:005 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs,
           so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of
           Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the
           Chaldeans for their good.

24:024:006 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring
           them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull
           them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.

24:024:007 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD:
           and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they
           shall return unto me with their whole heart.

24:024:008 And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
           surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king
           of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that
           remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:

24:024:009 And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of
           the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a
           taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.

24:024:010 And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
           among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I
           gave unto them and to their fathers.

24:025:001 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of
           Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
           of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of
           Babylon;

24:025:002 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of
           Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,

24:025:003 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of
           Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth
           year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have
           spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not
           hearkened.

24:025:004 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets,
           rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor
           inclined your ear to hear.

24:025:005 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and
           from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the
           LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and
           ever:

24:025:006 And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship
           them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your
           hands; and I will do you no hurt.

24:025:007 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye
           might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your
           own hurt.

24:025:008 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not
           heard my words,

24:025:009 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,
           saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my
           servant, and will bring them against this land, and against
           the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round
           about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an
           astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.

24:025:010 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the
           voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice
           of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of
           the candle.

24:025:011 And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an
           astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of
           Babylon seventy years.

24:025:012 And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are
           accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that
           nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of
           the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.

24:025:013 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have
           pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book,
           which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.

24:025:014 For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of
           them also: and I will recompense them according to their
           deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.

24:025:015 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine
           cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to
           whom I send thee, to drink it.

24:025:016 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the
           sword that I will send among them.

24:025:017 Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the
           nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:

24:025:018 To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings
           thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation,
           an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;

24:025:019 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and
           all his people;

24:025:020 And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of
           Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and
           Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,

24:025:021 Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,

24:025:022 And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and
           the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,

24:025:023 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost
           corners,

24:025:024 And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled
           people that dwell in the desert,

24:025:025 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all
           the kings of the Medes,

24:025:026 And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with
           another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the
           face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after
           them.

24:025:027 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of
           hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue,
           and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will
           send among you.

24:025:028 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand
           to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD
           of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.

24:025:029 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by
           my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be
           unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the
           inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.

24:025:030 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say
           unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his
           voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon
           his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the
           grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.

24:025:031 A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD
           hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all
           flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith
           the LORD.

24:025:032 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from
           nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up
           from the coasts of the earth.

24:025:033 And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of
           the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not
           be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung
           upon the ground.

24:025:034 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the
           ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your
           slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye
           shall fall like a pleasant vessel.

24:025:035 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal
           of the flock to escape.

24:025:036 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the
           principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath
           spoiled their pasture.

24:025:037 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the
           fierce anger of the LORD.

24:025:038 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is
           desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and
           because of his fierce anger.

24:026:001 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
           king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,

24:026:002 Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house,
           and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship
           in the LORD's house, all the words that I command thee to
           speak unto them; diminish not a word:

24:026:003 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil
           way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do
           unto them because of the evil of their doings.

24:026:004 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will
           not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before
           you,

24:026:005 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I
           sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye
           have not hearkened;

24:026:006 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this
           city a curse to all the nations of the earth.

24:026:007 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard
           Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.

24:026:008 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
           all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the
           people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people
           took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.

24:026:009 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This
           house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate
           without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered
           against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.

24:026:010 When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came
           up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat
           down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.

24:026:011 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and
           to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he
           hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your
           ears.

24:026:012 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the
           people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this
           house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.

24:026:013 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the
           voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of
           the evil that he hath pronounced against you.

24:026:014 As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth
           good and meet unto you.

24:026:015 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall
           surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this
           city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the
           LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your
           ears.

24:026:016 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and
           to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath
           spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.

24:026:017 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to
           all the assembly of the people, saying,

24:026:018 Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king
           of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus
           saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field,
           and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the
           house as the high places of a forest.

24:026:019 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to
           death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and
           the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced
           against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our
           souls.

24:026:020 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
           LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who
           prophesied against this city and against this land according
           to all the words of Jeremiah.

24:026:021 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all
           the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to
           death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and
           went into Egypt;

24:026:022 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan
           the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.

24:026:023 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him
           unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast
           his dead body into the graves of the common people.

24:026:024 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with
           Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the
           people to put him to death.

24:027:001 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
           king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD,
           saying,

24:027:002 Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put
           them upon thy neck,

24:027:003 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,
           and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus,
           and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which
           come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;

24:027:004 And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the
           LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your
           masters;

24:027:005 I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the
           ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have
           given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.

24:027:006 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of
           Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts
           of the field have I given him also to serve him.

24:027:007 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's
           son, until the very time of his land come: and then many
           nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.

24:027:008 And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which
           will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,
           and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of
           Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the
           sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I
           have consumed them by his hand.

24:027:009 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your
           diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to
           your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not
           serve the king of Babylon:

24:027:010 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your
           land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.

24:027:011 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the
           king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still
           in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and
           dwell therein.

24:027:012 I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these
           words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of
           Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.

24:027:013 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the
           famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against
           the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?

24:027:014 Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that
           speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of
           Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.

24:027:015 For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a
           lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might
           perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.

24:027:016 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying,
           Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets
           that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the
           LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon:
           for they prophesy a lie unto you.

24:027:017 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
           wherefore should this city be laid waste?

24:027:018 But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with
           them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts,
           that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and
           in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to
           Babylon.

24:027:019 For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and
           concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning
           the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.

24:027:020 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried
           away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from
           Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and
           Jerusalem;

24:027:021 Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
           concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD,
           and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;

24:027:022 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be
           until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I
           bring them up, and restore them to this place.

24:028:001 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the
           reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in
           the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet,
           which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD,
           in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,

24:028:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I
           have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.

24:028:003 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all
           the vessels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of
           Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to
           Babylon:

24:028:004 And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of
           Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that
           went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke
           of the king of Babylon.

24:028:005 Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in
           the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the
           people that stood in the house of the LORD,

24:028:006 Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD
           perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again
           the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away
           captive, from Babylon into this place.

24:028:007 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine
           ears, and in the ears of all the people;

24:028:008 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old
           prophesied both against many countries, and against great
           kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.

24:028:009 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the
           prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known,
           that the LORD hath truly sent him.

24:028:010 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
           Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.

24:028:011 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,
           Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of
           Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations
           within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah
           went his way.

24:028:012 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet,
           after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off
           the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

24:028:013 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast
           broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes
           of iron.

24:028:014 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have
           put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that
           they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall
           serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.

24:028:015 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear
           now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest
           this people to trust in a lie.

24:028:016 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from
           off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because
           thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.

24:028:017 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh
           month.

24:029:001 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the
           prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders
           which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to
           the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had
           carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;

24:029:002 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs,
           the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and
           the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)

24:029:003 By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son
           of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to
           Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,

24:029:004 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that
           are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried
           away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;

24:029:005 Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat
           the fruit of them;

24:029:006 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives
           for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they
           may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there,
           and not diminished.

24:029:007 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be
           carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in
           the peace thereof shall ye have peace.

24:029:008 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not
           your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you,
           deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to
           be dreamed.

24:029:009 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent
           them, saith the LORD.

24:029:010 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be
           accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good
           word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.

24:029:011 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the
           LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an
           expected end.

24:029:012 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,
           and I will hearken unto you.

24:029:013 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me
           with all your heart.

24:029:014 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn
           away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the
           nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you,
           saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place
           whence I caused you to be carried away captive.

24:029:015 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in
           Babylon;

24:029:016 Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon
           the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in
           this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with
           you into captivity;

24:029:017 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them
           the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them
           like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

24:029:018 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and
           with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to
           all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an
           astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the
           nations whither I have driven them:

24:029:019 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD,
           which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up
           early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.

24:029:020 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the
           captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:

24:029:021 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the
           son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which
           prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver
           them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he
           shall slay them before your eyes;

24:029:022 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of
           Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like
           Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in
           the fire;

24:029:023 Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have
           committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have
           spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded
           them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD.

24:029:024 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

24:029:025 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
           Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people
           that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah
           the priest, and to all the priests, saying,

24:029:026 The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the
           priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD,
           for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that
           thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.

24:029:027 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,
           which maketh himself a prophet to you?

24:029:028 For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This
           captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and
           plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

24:029:029 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
           Jeremiah the prophet.

24:029:030 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

24:029:031 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD
           concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath
           prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to
           trust in a lie:

24:029:032 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah
           the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell
           among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I
           will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught
           rebellion against the LORD.

24:030:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

24:030:002 Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all
           the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.

24:030:003 For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring
           again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the
           LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave
           to their fathers, and they shall possess it.

24:030:004 And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel
           and concerning Judah.

24:030:005 For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling,
           of fear, and not of peace.

24:030:006 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?
           wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a
           woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?

24:030:007 Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is
           even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of
           it.

24:030:008 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of
           hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will
           burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves
           of him:

24:030:009 But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king,
           whom I will raise up unto them.

24:030:010 Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD;
           neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from
           afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob
           shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none
           shall make him afraid.

24:030:011 For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I
           make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee,
           yet I will not make a full end of thee: but I will correct
           thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether
           unpunished.

24:030:012 For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy
           wound is grievous.

24:030:013 There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound
           up: thou hast no healing medicines.

24:030:014 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I
           have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the
           chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine
           iniquity; because thy sins were increased.

24:030:015 Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable
           for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were
           increased, I have done these things unto thee.

24:030:016 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all
           thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity;
           and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey
           upon thee will I give for a prey.

24:030:017 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of
           thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an
           Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.

24:030:018 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity
           of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and
           the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace
           shall remain after the manner thereof.

24:030:019 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of
           them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall
           not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be
           small.

24:030:020 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their
           congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish
           all that oppress them.

24:030:021 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor
           shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to
           draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that
           engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.

24:030:022 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

24:030:023 Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a
           continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of
           the wicked.

24:030:024 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath
           done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart:
           in the latter days ye shall consider it.

24:031:001 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the
           families of Israel, and they shall be my people.

24:031:002 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword
           found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to
           cause him to rest.

24:031:003 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have
           loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with
           lovingkindness have I drawn thee.

24:031:004 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of
           Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and
           shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.

24:031:005 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
           planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.

24:031:006 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount
           Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the
           LORD our God.

24:031:007 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and
           shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye,
           and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.

24:031:008 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather
           them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and
           the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with
           child together: a great company shall return thither.

24:031:009 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I
           lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters
           in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a
           father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.

24:031:010 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the
           isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather
           him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.

24:031:011 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the
           hand of him that was stronger than he.

24:031:012 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and
           shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat,
           and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and
           of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and
           they shall not sorrow any more at all.

24:031:013 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and
           old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and
           will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.

24:031:014 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and
           my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.

24:031:015 Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,
           and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to
           be comforted for her children, because they were not.

24:031:016 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine
           eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the
           LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.

24:031:017 And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy
           children shall come again to their own border.

24:031:018 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast
           chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed
           to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art
           the LORD my God.

24:031:019 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I
           was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea,
           even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.

24:031:020 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I
           spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still:
           therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have
           mercy upon him, saith the LORD.

24:031:021 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart
           toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn
           again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.

24:031:022 How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for
           the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall
           compass a man.

24:031:023 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they
           shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities
           thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD
           bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.

24:031:024 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities
           thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with
           flocks.

24:031:025 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished
           every sorrowful soul.

24:031:026 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto
           me.

24:031:027 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the
           house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man,
           and with the seed of beast.

24:031:028 And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over
           them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and
           to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to
           build, and to plant, saith the LORD.

24:031:029 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a
           sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.

24:031:030 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that
           eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.

24:031:031 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new
           covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of
           Judah:

24:031:032 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
           in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of
           the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I
           was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:

24:031:033 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house
           of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law
           in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will
           be their God, and they shall be my people.

24:031:034 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and
           every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall
           all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
           saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
           remember their sin no more.

24:031:035 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,
           and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by
           night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The
           LORD of hosts is his name:

24:031:036 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD,
           then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation
           before me for ever.

24:031:037 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the
           foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also
           cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done,
           saith the LORD.

24:031:038 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be
           built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of
           the corner.

24:031:039 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon
           the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.

24:031:040 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and
           all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of
           the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD;
           it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

24:032:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year
           of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of
           Nebuchadrezzar.

24:032:002 For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and
           Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison,
           which was in the king of Judah's house.

24:032:003 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore
           dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I
           will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and
           he shall take it;

24:032:004 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of
           the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of
           the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth,
           and his eyes shall behold his eyes;

24:032:005 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be
           until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the
           Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.

24:032:006 And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

24:032:007 Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come
           unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for
           the right of redemption is thine to buy it.

24:032:008 So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the
           prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me,
           Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in
           the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is
           thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I
           knew that this was the word of the LORD.

24:032:009 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in
           Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of
           silver.

24:032:010 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took
           witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.

24:032:011 So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was
           sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was
           open:

24:032:012 And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of
           Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine
           uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that
           subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that
           sat in the court of the prison.

24:032:013 And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

24:032:014 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these
           evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is
           sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an
           earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.

24:032:015 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses
           and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this
           land.

24:032:016 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
           Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,

24:032:017 Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth
           by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing
           too hard for thee:

24:032:018 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest
           the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children
           after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is
           his name,

24:032:019 Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open
           upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one
           according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
           doings:

24:032:020 Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even
           unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast
           made thee a name, as at this day;

24:032:021 And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of
           Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand,
           and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;

24:032:022 And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their
           fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;

24:032:023 And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy
           voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of
           all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast
           caused all this evil to come upon them:

24:032:024 Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and
           the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight
           against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of
           the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass;
           and, behold, thou seest it.

24:032:025 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for
           money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand
           of the Chaldeans.

24:032:026 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

24:032:027 Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any
           thing too hard for me?

24:032:028 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city
           into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of
           Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:

24:032:029 And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come
           and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon
           whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured
           out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.

24:032:030 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only
           done evil before me from their youth: for the children of
           Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their
           hands, saith the LORD.

24:032:031 For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger
           and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this
           day; that I should remove it from before my face,

24:032:032 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the
           children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to
           anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and
           their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of
           Jerusalem.

24:032:033 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face:
           though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet
           they have not hearkened to receive instruction.

24:032:034 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called
           by my name, to defile it.

24:032:035 And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the
           valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their
           daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I
           commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they
           should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.

24:032:036 And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
           concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered
           into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the
           famine, and by the pestilence;

24:032:037 Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I
           have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great
           wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will
           cause them to dwell safely:

24:032:038 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:

24:032:039 And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may
           fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children
           after them:

24:032:040 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will
           not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my
           fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.

24:032:041 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will
           plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with
           my whole soul.

24:032:042 For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great
           evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good
           that I have promised them.

24:032:043 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is
           desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of
           the Chaldeans.

24:032:044 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
           seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in
           the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in
           the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley,
           and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their
           captivity to return, saith the LORD.

24:033:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second
           time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison,
           saying,

24:033:002 Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed
           it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;

24:033:003 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and
           mighty things, which thou knowest not.

24:033:004 For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the
           houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of
           Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;

24:033:005 They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them
           with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger
           and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my
           face from this city.

24:033:006 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,
           and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.

24:033:007 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of
           Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.

24:033:008 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they
           have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their
           iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have
           transgressed against me.

24:033:009 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
           before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the
           good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for
           all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure
           unto it.

24:033:010 Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place,
           which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast,
           even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem,
           that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and
           without beast,

24:033:011 The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
           bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that
           shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for
           his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the
           sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will
           cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first,
           saith the LORD.

24:033:012 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is
           desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities
           thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their
           flocks to lie down.

24:033:013 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and
           in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and
           in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah,
           shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that
           telleth them, saith the LORD.

24:033:014 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform
           that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel
           and to the house of Judah.

24:033:015 In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
           righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute
           judgment and righteousness in the land.

24:033:016 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
           safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called,
           The LORD our righteousness.

24:033:017 For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit
           upon the throne of the house of Israel;

24:033:018 Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to
           offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do
           sacrifice continually.

24:033:019 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,

24:033:020 Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day,
           and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day
           and night in their season;

24:033:021 Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant,
           that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and
           with the Levites the priests, my ministers.

24:033:022 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of
           the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my
           servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.

24:033:023 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,

24:033:024 Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The
           two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast
           them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should
           be no more a nation before them.

24:033:025 Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night,
           and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and
           earth;

24:033:026 Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant,
           so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the
           seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their
           captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

24:034:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when
           Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the
           kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people,
           fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof,
           saying,

24:034:002 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to
           Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD;
           Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of
           Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:

24:034:003 And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be
           taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall
           behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak
           with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.

24:034:004 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus
           saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:

24:034:005 But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy
           fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall
           they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying,
           Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.

24:034:006 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah
           king of Judah in Jerusalem,

24:034:007 When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and
           against all the cities of Judah that were left, against
           Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities
           remained of the cities of Judah.

24:034:008 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after
           that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people
           which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;

24:034:009 That every man should let his manservant, and every man his
           maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that
           none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his
           brother.

24:034:010 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had
           entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his
           manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none
           should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed,
           and let them go.

24:034:011 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the
           handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought
           them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.

24:034:012 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
           saying,

24:034:013 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with
           your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the
           land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,

24:034:014 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an
           Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath
           served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee:
           but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their
           ear.

24:034:015 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
           proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had
           made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my
           name:

24:034:016 But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his
           servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at
           liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into
           subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.

24:034:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me,
           in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every
           man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you,
           saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the
           famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the
           kingdoms of the earth.

24:034:018 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,
           which have not performed the words of the covenant which they
           had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and
           passed between the parts thereof,

24:034:019 The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the
           eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land,
           which passed between the parts of the calf;

24:034:020 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into
           the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies
           shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the
           beasts of the earth.

24:034:021 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into
           the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek
           their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army,
           which are gone up from you.

24:034:022 Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to
           return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take
           it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah
           a desolation without an inhabitant.

24:035:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of
           Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

24:035:002 Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and
           bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the
           chambers, and give them wine to drink.

24:035:003 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of
           Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole
           house of the Rechabites;

24:035:004 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the
           chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of
           God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above
           the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the
           door:

24:035:005 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots
           full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.

24:035:006 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
           Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no
           wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:

24:035:007 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant
           vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in
           tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be
           strangers.

24:035:008 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our
           father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all
           our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;

24:035:009 Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we
           vineyard, nor field, nor seed:

24:035:010 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done
           according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

24:035:011 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came
           up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to
           Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear
           of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.

24:035:012 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

24:035:013 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell
           the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not
           receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.

24:035:014 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his
           sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they
           drink none, but obey their father's commandment:
           notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and
           speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.

24:035:015 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
           up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man
           from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after
           other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which
           I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not
           inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.

24:035:016 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed
           the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but
           this people hath not hearkened unto me:

24:035:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel;
           Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants
           of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them:
           because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and
           I have called unto them, but they have not answered.

24:035:018 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith
           the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed
           the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his
           precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded
           you:

24:035:019 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
           Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before
           me for ever.

24:036:001 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
           Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from
           the LORD, saying,

24:036:002 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words
           that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against
           Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto
           thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.

24:036:003 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which
           I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from
           his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

24:036:004 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch
           wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD,
           which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

24:036:005 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot
           go into the house of the LORD:

24:036:006 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast
           written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of
           the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also
           thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of
           their cities.

24:036:007 It may be they will present their supplication before the
           LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great
           is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced
           against this people.

24:036:008 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that
           Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the
           words of the LORD in the LORD's house.

24:036:009 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of
           Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed
           a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to
           all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto
           Jerusalem.

24:036:010 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the
           house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of
           Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the
           new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.

24:036:011 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had
           heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,

24:036:012 Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's
           chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the
           scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son
           of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the
           son of Hananiah, and all the princes.

24:036:013 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
           heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.

24:036:014 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah,
           the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying,
           Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears
           of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the
           roll in his hand, and came unto them.

24:036:015 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
           So Baruch read it in their ears.

24:036:016 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they
           were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will
           surely tell the king of all these words.

24:036:017 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou
           write all these words at his mouth?

24:036:018 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto
           me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.

24:036:019 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
           Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.

24:036:020 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up
           the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all
           the words in the ears of the king.

24:036:021 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out
           of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the
           ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which
           stood beside the king.

24:036:022 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and
           there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.

24:036:023 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four
           leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire
           that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the
           fire that was on the hearth.

24:036:024 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the
           king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.

24:036:025 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
           intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but
           he would not hear them.

24:036:026 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
           Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to
           take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD
           hid them.

24:036:027 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the
           king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at
           the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

24:036:028 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former
           words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of
           Judah hath burned.

24:036:029 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the
           LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou
           written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly
           come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from
           thence man and beast?

24:036:030 Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He
           shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead
           body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the
           night to the frost.

24:036:031 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
           iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants
           of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I
           have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.

24:036:032 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
           scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of
           Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of
           Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides
           unto them many like words.

24:037:001 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah
           the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made
           king in the land of Judah.

24:037:002 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land,
           did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the
           prophet Jeremiah.

24:037:003 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and
           Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet
           Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.

24:037:004 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they
           had not put him into prison.

24:037:005 Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the
           Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they
           departed from Jerusalem.

24:037:006 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah
           saying,

24:037:007 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to
           the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me;
           Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall
           return to Egypt into their own land.

24:037:008 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this
           city, and take it, and burn it with fire.

24:037:009 Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The
           Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not
           depart.

24:037:010 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that
           fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among
           them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn
           this city with fire.

24:037:011 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was
           broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,

24:037:012 Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land
           of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the
           people.

24:037:013 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward
           was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the
           son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
           Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.

24:037:014 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the
           Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took
           Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.

24:037:015 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,
           and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for
           they had made that the prison.

24:037:016 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the
           cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;

24:037:017 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king
           asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word
           from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou
           shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.

24:037:018 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I
           offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against
           this people, that ye have put me in prison?

24:037:019 Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying,
           The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against
           this land?

24:037:020 Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my
           supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou
           cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe,
           lest I die there.

24:037:021 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit
           Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should
           give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street,
           until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah
           remained in the court of the prison.

24:038:001 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
           Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of
           Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all
           the people, saying,

24:038:002 Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die
           by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he
           that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall
           have his life for a prey, and shall live.

24:038:003 Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the
           hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.

24:038:004 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let
           this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of
           the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all
           the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man
           seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.

24:038:005 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for
           the king is not he that can do any thing against you.

24:038:006 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
           Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the
           prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the
           dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the
           mire.

24:038:007 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which
           was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in
           the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;

24:038:008 Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to
           the king saying,

24:038:009 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they
           have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into
           the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place
           where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.

24:038:010 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take
           from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the
           prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.

24:038:011 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house
           of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast
           clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into
           the dungeon to Jeremiah.

24:038:012 And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these
           old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the
           cords. And Jeremiah did so.

24:038:013 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of
           the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

24:038:014 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet
           unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the
           LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a
           thing; hide nothing from me.

24:038:015 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,
           wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee
           counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?

24:038:016 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As
           the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee
           to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men
           that seek thy life.

24:038:017 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God
           of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth
           unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live,
           and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt
           live, and thine house:

24:038:018 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's
           princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the
           Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt
           not escape out of their hand.

24:038:019 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
           Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me
           into their hand, and they mock me.

24:038:020 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I
           beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee:
           so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.

24:038:021 But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD
           hath shewed me:

24:038:022 And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of
           Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's
           princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee
           on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the
           mire, and they are turned away back.

24:038:023 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the
           Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but
           shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou
           shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.

24:038:024 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these
           words, and thou shalt not die.

24:038:025 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
           come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what
           thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will
           not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:

24:038:026 Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication
           before the king, that he would not cause me to return to
           Jonathan's house, to die there.

24:038:027 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he
           told them according to all these words that the king had
           commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter
           was not perceived.

24:038:028 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day
           that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was
           taken.

24:039:001 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth
           month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army
           against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.

24:039:002 And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the
           ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.

24:039:003 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in
           the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim,
           Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the
           princes of the king of Babylon.

24:039:004 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
           them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth
           out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by
           the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the
           plain.

24:039:005 But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook
           Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken
           him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to
           Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.

24:039:006 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
           before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles
           of Judah.

24:039:007 Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with
           chains, to carry him to Babylon.

24:039:008 And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of
           the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.

24:039:009 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
           into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the
           city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the
           rest of the people that remained.

24:039:010 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of
           the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave
           them vineyards and fields at the same time.

24:039:011 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
           Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,

24:039:012 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do
           unto him even as he shall say unto thee.

24:039:013 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
           Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of
           Babylon's princes;

24:039:014 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the
           prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the
           son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt
           among the people.

24:039:015 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut
           up in the court of the prison, saying,

24:039:016 Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith
           the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my
           words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they
           shall be accomplished in that day before thee.

24:039:017 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou
           shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art
           afraid.

24:039:018 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the
           sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because
           thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.

24:040:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
           Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from
           Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all
           that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which
           were carried away captive unto Babylon.

24:040:002 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
           The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

24:040:003 Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath
           said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not
           obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.

24:040:004 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which
           were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with
           me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if
           it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear:
           behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good
           and convenient for thee to go, thither go.

24:040:005 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
           Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king
           of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and
           dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth
           convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave
           him victuals and a reward, and let him go.

24:040:006 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
           and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the
           land.

24:040:007 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the
           fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of
           Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the
           land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children,
           and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried
           away captive to Babylon;

24:040:008 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
           Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and
           Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the
           Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and
           their men.

24:040:009 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto
           them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the
           Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon,
           and it shall be well with you.

24:040:010 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the
           Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine,
           and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and
           dwell in your cities that ye have taken.

24:040:011 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
           Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries,
           heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah,
           and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the
           son of Shaphan;

24:040:012 Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were
           driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto
           Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.

24:040:013 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
           the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to
           Mizpah,

24:040:014 And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the
           king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
           to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them
           not.

24:040:015 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
           secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay
           Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it:
           wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are
           gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in
           Judah perish?

24:040:016 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of
           Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest
           falsely of Ishmael.

24:041:001 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
           of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the
           princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah
           the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread
           together in Mizpah.

24:041:002 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that
           were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of
           Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon
           had made governor over the land.

24:041:003 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with
           Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there,
           and the men of war.

24:041:004 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain
           Gedaliah, and no man knew it,

24:041:005 That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from
           Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and
           their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings
           and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the
           LORD.

24:041:006 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to
           meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass,
           as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of
           Ahikam.

24:041:007 And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that
           Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the
           midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.

24:041:008 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay
           us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of
           barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them
           not among their brethren.

24:041:009 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of
           the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which
           Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and
           Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were
           slain.

24:041:010 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the
           people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all
           the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the
           captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of
           Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away
           captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.

24:041:011 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
           the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that
           Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,

24:041:012 Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the
           son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are
           in Gibeon.

24:041:013 Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with
           Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
           the forces that were with him, then they were glad.

24:041:014 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from
           Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son
           of Kareah.

24:041:015 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with
           eight men, and went to the Ammonites.

24:041:016 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
           the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people
           whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from
           Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
           even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and
           the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:

24:041:017 And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham,
           which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,

24:041:018 Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them,
           because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the
           son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the
           land.

24:042:001 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
           Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people
           from the least even unto the greatest, came near,

24:042:002 And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
           supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the
           LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but
           a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)

24:042:003 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk,
           and the thing that we may do.

24:042:004 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;
           behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your
           words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the
           LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep
           nothing back from you.

24:042:005 Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful
           witness between us, if we do not even according to all things
           for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.

24:042:006 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the
           voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may
           be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.

24:042:007 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD
           came unto Jeremiah.

24:042:008 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
           of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the
           least even to the greatest,

24:042:009 And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
           unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;

24:042:010 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you,
           and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you
           up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.

24:042:011 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid;
           be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to
           save you, and to deliver you from his hand.

24:042:012 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon
           you, and cause you to return to your own land.

24:042:013 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey
           the voice of the LORD your God,

24:042:014 Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we
           shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have
           hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:

24:042:015 And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of
           Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye
           wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn
           there;

24:042:016 Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared,
           shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine,
           whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in
           Egypt; and there ye shall die.

24:042:017 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go
           into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by
           the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall
           remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.

24:042:018 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine
           anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants
           of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when
           ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and
           an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see
           this place no more.

24:042:019 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go
           ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you
           this day.

24:042:020 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the
           LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and
           according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare
           unto us, and we will do it.

24:042:021 And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not
           obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the
           which he hath sent me unto you.

24:042:022 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword,
           by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye
           desire to go and to sojourn.

24:043:001 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of
           speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their
           God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even
           all these words,

24:043:002 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of
           Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou
           speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say,
           Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:

24:043:003 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for
           to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might
           put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.

24:043:004 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
           forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD,
           to dwell in the land of Judah.

24:043:005 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
           forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from
           all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the
           land of Judah;

24:043:006 Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters,
           and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had
           left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and
           Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.

24:043:007 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the
           voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.

24:043:008 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
           saying,

24:043:009 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in
           the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in
           Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;

24:043:010 And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
           Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king
           of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these
           stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion
           over them.

24:043:011 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and
           deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for
           captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the
           sword.

24:043:012 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt;
           and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he
           shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd
           putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in
           peace.

24:043:013 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the
           land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians
           shall he burn with fire.

24:044:001 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which
           dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at
           Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,

24:044:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen
           all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all
           the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a
           desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,

24:044:003 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to
           provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to
           serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor
           your fathers.

24:044:004 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
           early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable
           thing that I hate.

24:044:005 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from
           their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.

24:044:006 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was
           kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of
           Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.

24:044:007 Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God
           of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your
           souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling,
           out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;

24:044:008 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands,
           burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither
           ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and
           that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations
           of the earth?

24:044:009 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the
           wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their
           wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your
           wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in
           the streets of Jerusalem?

24:044:010 They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they
           feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set
           before you and before your fathers.

24:044:011 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
           Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut
           off all Judah.

24:044:012 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their
           faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they
           shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they
           shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they
           shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword
           and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an
           astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.

24:044:013 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I
           have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by
           the pestilence:

24:044:014 So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the
           land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that
           they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they
           have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return
           but such as shall escape.

24:044:015 Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned
           incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a
           great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of
           Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,

24:044:016 As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of
           the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.

24:044:017 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of
           our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and
           to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and
           our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of
           Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty
           of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.

24:044:018 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven,
           and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all
           things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.

24:044:019 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured
           out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship
           her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?

24:044:020 Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the
           women, and to all the people which had given him that answer,
           saying,

24:044:021 The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the
           streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and
           your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD
           remember them, and came it not into his mind?

24:044:022 So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of
           your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have
           committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an
           astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this
           day.

24:044:023 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned
           against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD,
           nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his
           testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at
           this day.

24:044:024 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the
           women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the
           land of Egypt:

24:044:025 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye
           and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and
           fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our
           vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of
           heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will
           surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.

24:044:026 Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell
           in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name,
           saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the
           mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying,
           The Lord GOD liveth.

24:044:027 Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and
           all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be
           consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end
           of them.

24:044:028 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of
           the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant
           of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn
           there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.

24:044:029 And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will
           punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall
           surely stand against you for evil:

24:044:030 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of
           Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them
           that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the
           hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that
           sought his life.

24:045:001 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son
           of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the
           mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
           Josiah king of Judah, saying,

24:045:002 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:

24:045:003 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief
           to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

24:045:004 Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold,
           that which I have built will I break down, and that which I
           have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.

24:045:005 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for,
           behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but
           thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places
           whither thou goest.

24:046:001 The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet
           against the Gentiles;

24:046:002 Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt,
           which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which
           Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of
           Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.

24:046:003 Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.

24:046:004 Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth
           with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the
           brigandines.

24:046:005 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and
           their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and
           look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD.

24:046:006 Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they
           shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river
           Euphrates.

24:046:007 Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved
           as the rivers?

24:046:008 Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like
           the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the
           earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.

24:046:009 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty
           men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle
           the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.

24:046:010 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of
           vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the
           sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk
           with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice
           in the north country by the river Euphrates.

24:046:011 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of
           Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt
           not be cured.

24:046:012 The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled
           the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty,
           and they are fallen both together.

24:046:013 The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how
           Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land
           of Egypt.

24:046:014 Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in
           Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee;
           for the sword shall devour round about thee.

24:046:015 Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because
           the LORD did drive them.

24:046:016 He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they
           said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the
           land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.

24:046:017 They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he
           hath passed the time appointed.

24:046:018 As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
           Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the
           sea, so shall he come.

24:046:019 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into
           captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an
           inhabitant.

24:046:020 Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it
           cometh out of the north.

24:046:021 Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted
           bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away
           together: they did not stand, because the day of their
           calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.

24:046:022 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall
           march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers
           of wood.

24:046:023 They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it
           cannot be searched; because they are more than the
           grasshoppers, and are innumerable.

24:046:024 The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be
           delivered into the hand of the people of the north.

24:046:025 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will
           punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their
           gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust
           in him:

24:046:026 And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their
           lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
           and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be
           inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.

24:046:027 But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O
           Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy
           seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return,
           and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.

24:046:028 Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am
           with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations
           whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of
           thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee
           wholly unpunished.

24:047:001 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
           the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.

24:047:002 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north,
           and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the
           land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell
           therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of
           the land shall howl.

24:047:003 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong
           horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of
           his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children
           for feebleness of hands;

24:047:004 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines,
           and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that
           remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the
           remnant of the country of Caphtor.

24:047:005 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the
           remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?

24:047:006 O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be
           quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.

24:047:007 How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge
           against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he
           appointed it.

24:048:001 Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
           Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and
           taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.

24:048:002 There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have
           devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from
           being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the
           sword shall pursue thee.

24:048:003 A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great
           destruction.

24:048:004 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be
           heard.

24:048:005 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up;
           for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry
           of destruction.

24:048:006 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the
           wilderness.

24:048:007 For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy
           treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go
           forth into captivity with his priests and his princes
           together.

24:048:008 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall
           escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be
           destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.

24:048:009 Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the
           cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell
           therein.

24:048:010 Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
           cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.

24:048:011 Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on
           his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
           neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste
           remained in him, and his scent is not changed.

24:048:012 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
           send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and
           shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.

24:048:013 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel
           was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.

24:048:014 How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?

24:048:015 Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen
           young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King,
           whose name is the LORD of hosts.

24:048:016 The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction
           hasteth fast.

24:048:017 All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know
           his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the
           beautiful rod!

24:048:018 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy
           glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come
           upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.

24:048:019 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him
           that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?

24:048:020 Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell
           ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,

24:048:021 And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and
           upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,

24:048:022 And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,

24:048:023 And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,

24:048:024 And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of
           the land of Moab, far or near.

24:048:025 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the
           LORD.

24:048:026 Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the
           LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall
           be in derision.

24:048:027 For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among
           thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for
           joy.

24:048:028 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the
           rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides
           of the hole's mouth.

24:048:029 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
           loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the
           haughtiness of his heart.

24:048:030 I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his
           lies shall not so effect it.

24:048:031 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all
           Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.

24:048:032 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of
           Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to
           the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits
           and upon thy vintage.

24:048:033 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and
           from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the
           winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting
           shall be no shouting.

24:048:034 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto
           Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto
           Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also
           of Nimrim shall be desolate.

24:048:035 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him
           that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense
           to his gods.

24:048:036 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine
           heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because
           the riches that he hath gotten are perished.

24:048:037 For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon
           all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.

24:048:038 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
           Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like
           a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.

24:048:039 They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab
           turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a
           dismaying to all them about him.

24:048:040 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and
           shall spread his wings over Moab.

24:048:041 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the
           mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart
           of a woman in her pangs.

24:048:042 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he
           hath magnified himself against the LORD.

24:048:043 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O
           inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.

24:048:044 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he
           that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare:
           for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their
           visitation, saith the LORD.

24:048:045 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of
           the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a
           flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of
           Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.

24:048:046 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for
           thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.

24:048:047 Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter
           days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

24:049:001 Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no
           sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad,
           and his people dwell in his cities?

24:049:002 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
           cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites;
           and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be
           burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that
           were his heirs, saith the LORD.

24:049:003 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of
           Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by
           the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his
           priests and his princes together.

24:049:004 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
           backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying,
           Who shall come unto me?

24:049:005 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of
           hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be
           driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him
           that wandereth.

24:049:006 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children
           of Ammon, saith the LORD.

24:049:007 Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no
           more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their
           wisdom vanished?

24:049:008 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I
           will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will
           visit him.

24:049:009 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some
           gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till
           they have enough.

24:049:010 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,
           and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled,
           and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.

24:049:011 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and
           let thy widows trust in me.

24:049:012 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not
           to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he
           that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go
           unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.

24:049:013 For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall
           become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all
           the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.

24:049:014 I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent
           unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against
           her, and rise up to the battle.

24:049:015 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and
           despised among men.

24:049:016 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine
           heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that
           holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy
           nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence,
           saith the LORD.

24:049:017 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it
           shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues
           thereof.

24:049:018 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
           cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there,
           neither shall a son of man dwell in it.

24:049:019 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
           Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will
           suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man,
           that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will
           appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand
           before me?

24:049:020 Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
           against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against
           the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall
           draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate
           with them.

24:049:021 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the
           noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.

24:049:022 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his
           wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the
           mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

24:049:023 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they
           have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is
           sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.

24:049:024 Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and
           fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her,
           as a woman in travail.

24:049:025 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!

24:049:026 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the
           men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of
           hosts.

24:049:027 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
           consume the palaces of Benhadad.

24:049:028 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
           Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the
           LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.

24:049:029 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall
           take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and
           their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every
           side.

24:049:030 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
           saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken
           counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.

24:049:031 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth
           without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor
           bars, which dwell alone.

24:049:032 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their
           cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that
           are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity
           from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.

24:049:033 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation
           for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man
           dwell in it.

24:049:034 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
           Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,
           saying,

24:049:035 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of
           Elam, the chief of their might.

24:049:036 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four
           quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those
           winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of
           Elam shall not come.

24:049:037 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and
           before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon
           them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send
           the sword after them, till I have consumed them:

24:049:038 And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence
           the king and the princes, saith the LORD.

24:049:039 But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will
           bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.

24:050:001 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the
           land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.

24:050:002 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a
           standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel
           is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are
           confounded, her images are broken in pieces.

24:050:003 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her,
           which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell
           therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and
           beast.

24:050:004 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children
           of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together,
           going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.

24:050:005 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,
           saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a
           perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.

24:050:006 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused
           them to go astray, they have turned them away on the
           mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have
           forgotten their restingplace.

24:050:007 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries
           said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the
           LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of
           their fathers.

24:050:008 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the
           land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the
           flocks.

24:050:009 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
           assembly of great nations from the north country: and they
           shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she
           shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert
           man; none shall return in vain.

24:050:010 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
           satisfied, saith the LORD.

24:050:011 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of
           mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at
           grass, and bellow as bulls;

24:050:012 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall
           be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a
           wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.

24:050:013 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited,
           but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by
           Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.

24:050:014 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye
           that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath
           sinned against the LORD.

24:050:015 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
           foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is
           the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she
           hath done, do unto her.

24:050:016 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the
           sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing
           sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall
           flee every one to his own land.

24:050:017 Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away:
           first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this
           Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.

24:050:018 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
           Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I
           have punished the king of Assyria.

24:050:019 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall
           feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied
           upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.

24:050:020 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity
           of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and
           the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will
           pardon them whom I reserve.

24:050:021 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and
           against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy
           after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I
           have commanded thee.

24:050:022 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.

24:050:023 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken!
           how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!

24:050:024 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O
           Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also
           caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.

24:050:025 The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the
           weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord
           GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

24:050:026 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses:
           cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of
           her be left.

24:050:027 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe
           unto them! for their day is come, the time of their
           visitation.

24:050:028 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of
           Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God,
           the vengeance of his temple.

24:050:029 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend
           the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape:
           recompense her according to her work; according to all that
           she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against
           the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.

24:050:030 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her
           men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.

24:050:031 Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord
           GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit
           thee.

24:050:032 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall
           raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it
           shall devour all round about him.

24:050:033 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the
           children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took
           them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.

24:050:034 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he
           shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to
           the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.

24:050:035 A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the
           inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her
           wise men.

24:050:036 A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is
           upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.

24:050:037 A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and
           upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and
           they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and
           they shall be robbed.

24:050:038 A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for
           it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their
           idols.

24:050:039 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts
           of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell
           therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither
           shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.

24:050:040 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities
           thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither
           shall any son of man dwell therein.

24:050:041 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great
           nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of
           the earth.

24:050:042 They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and
           will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and
           they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a
           man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.

24:050:043 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his
           hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of
           a woman in travail.

24:050:044 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
           Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them
           suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I
           may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint
           me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before
           me?

24:050:045 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
           against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed
           against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the
           flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their
           habitation desolate with them.

24:050:046 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and
           the cry is heard among the nations.

24:051:001 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,
           and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up
           against me, a destroying wind;

24:051:002 And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and
           shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be
           against her round about.

24:051:003 Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and
           against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and
           spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.

24:051:004 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and
           they that are thrust through in her streets.

24:051:005 For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of
           the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin
           against the Holy One of Israel.

24:051:006 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his
           soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of
           the LORD's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.

24:051:007 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made
           all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine;
           therefore the nations are mad.

24:051:008 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take
           balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.

24:051:009 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake
           her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her
           judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the
           skies.

24:051:010 The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let
           us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.

24:051:011 Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath
           raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device
           is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance
           of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.

24:051:012 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch
           strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the
           LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against
           the inhabitants of Babylon.

24:051:013 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures,
           thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.

24:051:014 The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will
           fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift
           up a shout against thee.

24:051:015 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
           world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his
           understanding.

24:051:016 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
           the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the
           ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and
           bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

24:051:017 Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is
           confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is
           falsehood, and there is no breath in them.

24:051:018 They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their
           visitation they shall perish.

24:051:019 The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of
           all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD
           of hosts is his name.

24:051:020 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will
           I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy
           kingdoms;

24:051:021 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
           and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his
           rider;

24:051:022 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with
           thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will
           I break in pieces the young man and the maid;

24:051:023 I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his
           flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and
           his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces
           captains and rulers.

24:051:024 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of
           Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your
           sight, saith the LORD.

24:051:025 Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the
           LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out
           mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and
           will make thee a burnt mountain.

24:051:026 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a
           stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever,
           saith the LORD.

24:051:027 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the
           nations, prepare the nations against her, call together
           against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz;
           appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as
           the rough caterpillers.

24:051:028 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes,
           the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the
           land of his dominion.

24:051:029 And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of
           the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land
           of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.

24:051:030 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have
           remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became
           as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are
           broken.

24:051:031 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet
           another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at
           one end,

24:051:032 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have
           burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.

24:051:033 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The
           daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to
           thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest
           shall come.

24:051:034 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath
           crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed
           me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my
           delicates, he hath cast me out.

24:051:035 The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall
           the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants
           of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.

24:051:036 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause,
           and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and
           make her springs dry.

24:051:037 And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons,
           an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.

24:051:038 They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions'
           whelps.

24:051:039 In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them
           drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep,
           and not wake, saith the LORD.

24:051:040 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams
           with he goats.

24:051:041 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole
           earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among
           the nations!

24:051:042 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the
           multitude of the waves thereof.

24:051:043 Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a
           land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass
           thereby.

24:051:044 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out
           of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations
           shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of
           Babylon shall fall.

24:051:045 My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every
           man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.

24:051:046 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that
           shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year,
           and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and
           violence in the land, ruler against ruler.

24:051:047 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon
           the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be
           confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.

24:051:048 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall
           sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from
           the north, saith the LORD.

24:051:049 As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at
           Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.

24:051:050 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still:
           remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your
           mind.

24:051:051 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath
           covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries
           of the LORD's house.

24:051:052 Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
           do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land
           the wounded shall groan.

24:051:053 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she
           should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall
           spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.

24:051:054 A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction
           from the land of the Chaldeans:

24:051:055 Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of
           her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters,
           a noise of their voice is uttered:

24:051:056 Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and
           her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken:
           for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.

24:051:057 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her
           captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall
           sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose
           name is the LORD of hosts.

24:051:058 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall
           be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with
           fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the
           fire, and they shall be weary.

24:051:059 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son
           of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the
           king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign.
           And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.

24:051:060 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon
           Babylon, even all these words that are written against
           Babylon.

24:051:061 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and
           shalt see, and shalt read all these words;

24:051:062 Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this
           place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither
           man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.

24:051:063 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this
           book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the
           midst of Euphrates:

24:051:064 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not
           rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall
           be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

24:052:001 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
           and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

24:052:002 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD,
           according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

24:052:003 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
           and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that
           Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

24:052:004 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the
           tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
           Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army,
           against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts
           against it round about.

24:052:005 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
           Zedekiah.

24:052:006 And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the
           famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for
           the people of the land.

24:052:007 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and
           went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate
           between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now
           the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by
           the way of the plain.

24:052:008 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and
           overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army
           was scattered from him.

24:052:009 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of
           Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave
           judgment upon him.

24:052:010 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
           eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.

24:052:011 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
           bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him
           in prison till the day of his death.

24:052:012 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which
           was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
           came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king
           of Babylon, into Jerusalem,

24:052:013 And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and
           all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great
           men, burned he with fire:

24:052:014 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain
           of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round
           about.

24:052:015 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
           certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the
           people that remained in the city, and those that fell away,
           that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the
           multitude.

24:052:016 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the
           poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.

24:052:017 Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,
           and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the
           LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them
           to Babylon.

24:052:018 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
           bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith
           they ministered, took they away.

24:052:019 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the
           caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups;
           that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver
           in silver, took the captain of the guard away.

24:052:020 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were
           under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of
           the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.

24:052:021 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was
           eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it;
           and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.

24:052:022 And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one
           chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon
           the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar
           also and the pomegranates were like unto these.

24:052:023 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all
           the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.

24:052:024 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
           and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
           door:

24:052:025 He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge
           of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the
           king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal
           scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and
           threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in
           the midst of the city.

24:052:026 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought
           them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

24:052:027 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in
           Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away
           captive out of his own land.

24:052:028 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive:
           in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:

24:052:029 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away
           captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:

24:052:030 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan
           the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews
           seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were
           four thousand and six hundred.

24:052:031 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
           captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
           in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
           king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the
           head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of
           prison.

24:052:032 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne
           of the kings that were with him in Babylon,

24:052:033 And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat
           bread before him all the days of his life.

24:052:034 And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the
           king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his
           death, all the days of his life.

Book 25        Lamentations

25:001:001 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how
           is she become as a widow! she that was great among the
           nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become
           tributary!

25:001:002 She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her
           cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all
           her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become
           her enemies.

25:001:003 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and
           because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen,
           she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between
           the straits.

25:001:004 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn
           feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her
           virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.

25:001:005 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the
           LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her
           transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before
           the enemy.

25:001:006 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
           princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they
           are gone without strength before the pursuer.

25:001:007 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
           miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of
           old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none
           did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her
           sabbaths.

25:001:008 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed:
           all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her
           nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.

25:001:009 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last
           end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no
           comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath
           magnified himself.

25:001:010 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
           things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her
           sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter
           into thy congregation.

25:001:011 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their
           pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and
           consider; for I am become vile.

25:001:012 Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if
           there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto
           me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his
           fierce anger.

25:001:013 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth
           against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned
           me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.

25:001:014 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
           wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength
           to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from
           whom I am not able to rise up.

25:001:015 The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the
           midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my
           young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of
           Judah, as in a winepress.

25:001:016 For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with
           water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is
           far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy
           prevailed.

25:001:017 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort
           her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his
           adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a
           menstruous woman among them.

25:001:018 The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his
           commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my
           sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

25:001:019 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and
           mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought
           their meat to relieve their souls.

25:001:020 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;
           mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously
           rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as
           death.

25:001:021 They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all
           mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou
           hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,
           and they shall be like unto me.

25:001:022 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them,
           as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my
           sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

25:002:001 How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in
           his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty
           of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his
           anger!

25:002:002 The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and
           hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong
           holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to
           the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes
           thereof.

25:002:003 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he
           hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he
           burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth
           round about.

25:002:004 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right
           hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the
           eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out
           his fury like fire.

25:002:005 The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
           swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong
           holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning
           and lamentation.

25:002:006 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were
           of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the
           LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be
           forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his
           anger the king and the priest.

25:002:007 The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his
           sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the
           walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of
           the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.

25:002:008 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
           Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his
           hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the
           wall to lament; they languished together.

25:002:009 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and
           broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the
           Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision
           from the LORD.

25:002:010 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and
           keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they
           have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of
           Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.

25:002:011 Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver
           is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter
           of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in
           the streets of the city.

25:002:012 They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they
           swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their
           soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.

25:002:013 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall
           I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal
           to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?
           for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?

25:002:014 Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and
           they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy
           captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of
           banishment.

25:002:015 All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag
           their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the
           city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the
           whole earth?

25:002:016 All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they
           hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up:
           certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found,
           we have seen it.

25:002:017 The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath
           fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old:
           he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused
           thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of
           thine adversaries.

25:002:018 Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of
           Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give
           thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.

25:002:019 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches
           pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD:
           lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young
           children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.

25:002:020 Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.
           Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long?
           shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of
           the Lord?

25:002:021 The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my
           virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast
           slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and
           not pitied.

25:002:022 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so
           that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained:
           those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy
           consumed.

25:003:001 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his
           wrath.

25:003:002 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into
           light.

25:003:003 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me
           all the day.

25:003:004 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my
           bones.

25:003:005 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and
           travail.

25:003:006 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.

25:003:007 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made
           my chain heavy.

25:003:008 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

25:003:009 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my
           paths crooked.

25:003:010 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in
           secret places.

25:003:011 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath
           made me desolate.

25:003:012 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

25:003:013 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my
           reins.

25:003:014 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.

25:003:015 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken
           with wormwood.

25:003:016 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath
           covered me with ashes.

25:003:017 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
           prosperity.

25:003:018 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:

25:003:019 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and
           the gall.

25:003:020 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

25:003:021 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

25:003:022 It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because
           his compassions fail not.

25:003:023 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

25:003:024 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope
           in him.

25:003:025 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that
           seeketh him.

25:003:026 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for
           the salvation of the LORD.

25:003:027 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.

25:003:028 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it
           upon him.

25:003:029 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.

25:003:030 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full
           with reproach.

25:003:031 For the LORD will not cast off for ever:

25:003:032 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion
           according to the multitude of his mercies.

25:003:033 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of
           men.

25:003:034 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.

25:003:035 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most
           High,

25:003:036 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.

25:003:037 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord
           commandeth it not?

25:003:038 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and
           good?

25:003:039 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment
           of his sins?

25:003:040 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.

25:003:041 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the
           heavens.

25:003:042 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not
           pardoned.

25:003:043 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast
           slain, thou hast not pitied.

25:003:044 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should
           not pass through.

25:003:045 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst
           of the people.

25:003:046 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

25:003:047 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

25:003:048 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction
           of the daughter of my people.

25:003:049 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any
           intermission.

25:003:050 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.

25:003:051 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of
           my city.

25:003:052 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.

25:003:053 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone
           upon me.

25:003:054 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.

25:003:055 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.

25:003:056 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing,
           at my cry.

25:003:057 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou
           saidst, Fear not.

25:003:058 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast
           redeemed my life.

25:003:059 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

25:003:060 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
           against me.

25:003:061 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their
           imaginations against me;

25:003:062 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device
           against me all the day.

25:003:063 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their
           musick.

25:003:064 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work
           of their hands.

25:003:065 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

25:003:066 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of
           the LORD.

25:004:001 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!
           the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every
           street.

25:004:002 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are
           they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of
           the potter!

25:004:003 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to
           their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel,
           like the ostriches in the wilderness.

25:004:004 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his
           mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man
           breaketh it unto them.

25:004:005 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:
           they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.

25:004:006 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my
           people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,
           that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on
           her.

25:004:007 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than
           milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their
           polishing was of sapphire:

25:004:008 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the
           streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered,
           it is become like a stick.

25:004:009 They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be
           slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for
           want of the fruits of the field.

25:004:010 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
           they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my
           people.

25:004:011 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his
           fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath
           devoured the foundations thereof.

25:004:012 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
           would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy
           should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.

25:004:013 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her
           priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of
           her,

25:004:014 They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have
           polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch
           their garments.

25:004:015 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart,
           depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said
           among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.

25:004:016 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more
           regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests,
           they favoured not the elders.

25:004:017 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
           watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.

25:004:018 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end
           is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.

25:004:019 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven:
           they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in
           the wilderness.

25:004:020 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was
           taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we
           shall live among the heathen.

25:004:021 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the
           land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou
           shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.

25:004:022 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter
           of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he
           will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will
           discover thy sins.

25:005:001 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold
           our reproach.

25:005:002 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.

25:005:003 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.

25:005:004 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.

25:005:005 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.

25:005:006 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians,
           to be satisfied with bread.

25:005:007 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
           iniquities.

25:005:008 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver
           us out of their hand.

25:005:009 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the
           sword of the wilderness.

25:005:010 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible
           famine.

25:005:011 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities
           of Judah.

25:005:012 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were
           not honoured.

25:005:013 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under
           the wood.

25:005:014 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their
           musick.

25:005:015 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into
           mourning.

25:005:016 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have
           sinned!

25:005:017 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are
           dim.

25:005:018 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes
           walk upon it.

25:005:019 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation
           to generation.

25:005:020 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long
           time?

25:005:021 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew
           our days as of old.

25:005:022 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against
           us.

Book 26        Ezekiel

26:001:001 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth
           month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the
           captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened,
           and I saw visions of God.

26:001:002 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of
           king Jehoiachin's captivity,

26:001:003 The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest,
           the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river
           Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.

26:001:004 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,
           a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness
           was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of
           amber, out of the midst of the fire.

26:001:005 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
           creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the
           likeness of a man.

26:001:006 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.

26:001:007 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet
           was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the
           colour of burnished brass.

26:001:008 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their
           four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.

26:001:009 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when
           they went; they went every one straight forward.

26:001:010 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of
           a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they
           four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also
           had the face of an eagle.

26:001:011 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward;
           two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two
           covered their bodies.

26:001:012 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit
           was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.

26:001:013 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance
           was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of
           lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the
           fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

26:001:014 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of
           a flash of lightning.

26:001:015 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon
           the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.

26:001:016 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the
           colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their
           appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle
           of a wheel.

26:001:017 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they
           turned not when they went.

26:001:018 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;
           and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.

26:001:019 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them:
           and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth,
           the wheels were lifted up.

26:001:020 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was
           their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against
           them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

26:001:021 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these
           stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the
           wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the
           living creature was in the wheels.

26:001:022 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
           creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched
           forth over their heads above.

26:001:023 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one
           toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this
           side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their
           bodies.

26:001:024 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the
           noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice
           of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let
           down their wings.

26:001:025 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their
           heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.

26:001:026 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the
           likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone:
           and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the
           appearance of a man above upon it.

26:001:027 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire
           round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even
           upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I
           saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness
           round about.

26:001:028 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day
           of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.
           This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the
           LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a
           voice of one that spake.

26:002:001 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I
           will speak unto thee.

26:002:002 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set
           me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.

26:002:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children
           of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against
           me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even
           unto this very day.

26:002:004 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send
           thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the
           Lord GOD.

26:002:005 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will
           forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know
           that there hath been a prophet among them.

26:002:006 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid
           of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and
           thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words,
           nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious
           house.

26:002:007 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will
           hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most
           rebellious.

26:002:008 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou
           rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat
           that I give thee.

26:002:009 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo,
           a roll of a book was therein;

26:002:010 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and
           without: and there was written therein lamentations, and
           mourning, and woe.

26:003:001 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest;
           eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.

26:003:002 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.

26:003:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and
           fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I
           eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

26:003:004 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house
           of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.

26:003:005 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of
           an hard language, but to the house of Israel;

26:003:006 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard
           language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I
           sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.

26:003:007 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they
           will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are
           impudent and hardhearted.

26:003:008 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and
           thy forehead strong against their foreheads.

26:003:009 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear
           them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a
           rebellious house.

26:003:010 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I
           shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with
           thine ears.

26:003:011 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children
           of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith
           the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will
           forbear.

26:003:012 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a
           great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from
           his place.

26:003:013 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures
           that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over
           against them, and a noise of a great rushing.

26:003:014 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
           bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD
           was strong upon me.

26:003:015 Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by
           the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained
           there astonished among them seven days.

26:003:016 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of
           the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:003:017 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of
           Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
           warning from me.

26:003:018 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou
           givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from
           his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall
           die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine
           hand.

26:003:019 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his
           wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his
           iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

26:003:020 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness,
           and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him,
           he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he
           shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done
           shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine
           hand.

26:003:021 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the
           righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live,
           because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.

26:003:022 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto
           me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with
           thee.

26:003:023 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the
           glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the
           river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.

26:003:024 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and
           spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine
           house.

26:003:025 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon
           thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out
           among them:

26:003:026 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth,
           that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover:
           for they are a rebellious house.

26:003:027 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou
           shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth,
           let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for
           they are a rebellious house.

26:004:001 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before
           thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:

26:004:002 And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and
           cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set
           battering rams against it round about.

26:004:003 Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a
           wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face
           against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege
           against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.

26:004:004 Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the
           house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days
           that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.

26:004:005 For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity,
           according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety
           days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

26:004:006 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right
           side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah
           forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.

26:004:007 Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of
           Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt
           prophesy against it.

26:004:008 And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not
           turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the
           days of thy siege.

26:004:009 Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and
           lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel,
           and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the
           days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and
           ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.

26:004:010 And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty
           shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.

26:004:011 Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an
           hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.

26:004:012 And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it
           with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.

26:004:013 And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat
           their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive
           them.

26:004:014 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been
           polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten
           of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither
           came there abominable flesh into my mouth.

26:004:015 Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for
           man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.

26:004:016 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the
           staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by
           weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure,
           and with astonishment:

26:004:017 That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with
           another, and consume away for their iniquity.

26:005:001 And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a
           barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon
           thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the
           hair.

26:005:002 Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the
           city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt
           take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a
           third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out
           a sword after them.

26:005:003 Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in
           thy skirts.

26:005:004 Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the
           fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come
           forth into all the house of Israel.

26:005:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in
           the midst of the nations and countries that are round about
           her.

26:005:006 And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than
           the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are
           round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my
           statutes, they have not walked in them.

26:005:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more
           than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked
           in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have
           done according to the judgments of the nations that are round
           about you;

26:005:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am
           against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee
           in the sight of the nations.

26:005:009 And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and
           whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all
           thine abominations.

26:005:010 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee,
           and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute
           judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I
           scatter into all the winds.

26:005:011 Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou
           hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and
           with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish
           thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any
           pity.

26:005:012 A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with
           famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a
           third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I
           will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw
           out a sword after them.

26:005:013 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my
           fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they
           shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I
           have accomplished my fury in them.

26:005:014 Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the
           nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that
           pass by.

26:005:015 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
           astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when
           I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in
           furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.

26:005:016 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which
           shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to
           destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will
           break your staff of bread:

26:005:017 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall
           bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass through
           thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have
           spoken it.

26:006:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:006:002 Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and
           prophesy against them,

26:006:003 And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
           GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the
           hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I,
           will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high
           places.

26:006:004 And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be
           broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.

26:006:005 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel
           before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about
           your altars.

26:006:006 In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and
           the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be
           laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and
           cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be
           abolished.

26:006:007 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall
           know that I am the LORD.

26:006:008 Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall
           escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered
           through the countries.

26:006:009 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the
           nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am
           broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me,
           and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and
           they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have
           committed in all their abominations.

26:006:010 And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not
           said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.

26:006:011 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with
           thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the
           house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the
           famine, and by the pestilence.

26:006:012 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is
           near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is
           besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my
           fury upon them.

26:006:013 Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men
           shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon
           every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under
           every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where
           they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.

26:006:014 So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land
           desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward
           Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I
           am the LORD.

26:007:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:007:002 Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land
           of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of
           the land.

26:007:003 Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon
           thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will
           recompense upon thee all thine abominations.

26:007:004 And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity:
           but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine
           abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know
           that I am the LORD.

26:007:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is
           come.

26:007:006 An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold,
           it is come.

26:007:007 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the
           land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not
           the sounding again of the mountains.

26:007:008 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish
           mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy
           ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.

26:007:009 And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
           recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations
           that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the
           LORD that smiteth.

26:007:010 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;
           the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

26:007:011 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them
           shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's:
           neither shall there be wailing for them.

26:007:012 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
           rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the
           multitude thereof.

26:007:013 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold,
           although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the
           whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall
           any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

26:007:014 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
           goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude
           thereof.

26:007:015 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine
           within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and
           he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour
           him.

26:007:016 But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the
           mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning,
           every one for his iniquity.

26:007:017 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as
           water.

26:007:018 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror
           shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and
           baldness upon all their heads.

26:007:019 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold
           shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be
           able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they
           shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels:
           because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.

26:007:020 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but
           they made the images of their abominations and of their
           detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from
           them.

26:007:021 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,
           and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall
           pollute it.

26:007:022 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my
           secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile
           it.

26:007:023 Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the
           city is full of violence.

26:007:024 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they
           shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the
           strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

26:007:025 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall
           be none.

26:007:026 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon
           rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the
           law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the
           ancients.

26:007:027 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with
           desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be
           troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according
           to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I
           am the LORD.

26:008:001 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in
           the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the
           elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD
           fell there upon me.

26:008:002 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire:
           from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from
           his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the
           colour of amber.

26:008:003 And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of
           mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and
           the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem,
           to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north;
           where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh
           to jealousy.

26:008:004 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there,
           according to the vision that I saw in the plain.

26:008:005 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the
           way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward
           the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this
           image of jealousy in the entry.

26:008:006 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they
           do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel
           committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary?
           but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater
           abominations.

26:008:007 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
           behold a hole in the wall.

26:008:008 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and
           when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.

26:008:009 And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations
           that they do here.

26:008:010 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping
           things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house
           of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.

26:008:011 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the
           house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the
           son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a
           thick cloud of incense went up.

26:008:012 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
           ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in
           the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us
           not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.

26:008:013 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
           greater abominations that they do.

26:008:014 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house
           which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women
           weeping for Tammuz.

26:008:015 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn
           thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than
           these.

26:008:016 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house,
           and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between
           the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with
           their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces
           toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.

26:008:017 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it
           a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the
           abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the
           land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger:
           and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.

26:008:018 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,
           neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears
           with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.

26:009:001 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause
           them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every
           man with his destroying weapon in his hand.

26:009:002 And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate,
           which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon
           in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen,
           with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and
           stood beside the brasen altar.

26:009:003 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the
           cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And
           he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the
           writer's inkhorn by his side;

26:009:004 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,
           through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the
           foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the
           abominations that be done in the midst thereof.

26:009:005 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him
           through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither
           have ye pity:

26:009:006 Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children,
           and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark;
           and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men
           which were before the house.

26:009:007 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts
           with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in
           the city.

26:009:008 And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was
           left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord
           GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy
           pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?

26:009:009 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and
           Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and
           the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath
           forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.

26:009:010 And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I
           have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.

26:009:011 And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn
           by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou
           hast commanded me.

26:010:001 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above
           the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were
           a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a
           throne.

26:010:002 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in
           between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand
           with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter
           them over the city. And he went in in my sight.

26:010:003 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when
           the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

26:010:004 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood
           over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with
           the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the
           LORD's glory.

26:010:005 And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the
           outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he
           speaketh.

26:010:006 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man
           clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels,
           from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside
           the wheels.

26:010:007 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
           cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and
           took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was
           clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.

26:010:008 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand
           under their wings.

26:010:009 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims,
           one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub:
           and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl
           stone.

26:010:010 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as
           if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.

26:010:011 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned
           not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked
           they followed it; they turned not as they went.

26:010:012 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and
           their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about,
           even the wheels that they four had.

26:010:013 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
           wheel.

26:010:014 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
           cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the
           third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

26:010:015 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature
           that I saw by the river of Chebar.

26:010:016 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when
           the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the
           earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.

26:010:017 When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,
           these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living
           creature was in them.

26:010:018 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
           the house, and stood over the cherubims.

26:010:019 And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from
           the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also
           were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east
           gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel
           was over them above.

26:010:020 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
           by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the
           cherubims.

26:010:021 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and
           the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

26:010:022 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw
           by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they
           went every one straight forward.

26:011:001 Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east
           gate of the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold
           at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw
           Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah,
           princes of the people.

26:011:002 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that
           devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:

26:011:003 Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is
           the caldron, and we be the flesh.

26:011:004 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.

26:011:005 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me,
           Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of
           Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every
           one of them.

26:011:006 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled
           the streets thereof with the slain.

26:011:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have
           laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is
           the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of
           it.

26:011:008 Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,
           saith the Lord GOD.

26:011:009 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you
           into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among
           you.

26:011:010 Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of
           Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

26:011:011 This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the
           flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border
           of Israel:

26:011:012 And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked
           in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done
           after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.

26:011:013 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son
           of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with
           a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end
           of the remnant of Israel?

26:011:014 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:011:015 Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy
           kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto
           whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from
           the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.

26:011:016 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast
           them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered
           them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little
           sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.

26:011:017 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you
           from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where
           ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of
           Israel.

26:011:018 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the
           detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof
           from thence.

26:011:019 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit
           within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their
           flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:

26:011:020 That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances,
           and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
           God.

26:011:021 But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their
           detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense
           their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.

26:011:022 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels
           beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them
           above.

26:011:023 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,
           and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the
           city.

26:011:024 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision
           by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.
           So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

26:011:025 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that
           the LORD had shewed me.

26:012:001 The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,

26:012:002 Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house,
           which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear,
           and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.

26:012:003 Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing,
           and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from
           thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will
           consider, though they be a rebellious house.

26:012:004 Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight,
           as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in
           their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.

26:012:005 Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out
           thereby.

26:012:006 In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and
           carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face,
           that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign
           unto the house of Israel.

26:012:007 And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by
           day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through
           the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight,
           and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.

26:012:008 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

26:012:009 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious
           house, said unto thee, What doest thou?

26:012:010 Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden
           concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of
           Israel that are among them.

26:012:011 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done
           unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.

26:012:012 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder
           in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through
           the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that
           he see not the ground with his eyes.

26:012:013 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in
           my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the
           Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.

26:012:014 And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to
           help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword
           after them.

26:012:015 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter
           them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.

26:012:016 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the
           famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all
           their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and
           they shall know that I am the LORD.

26:012:017 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

26:012:018 Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water
           with trembling and with carefulness;

26:012:019 And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD
           of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel;
           They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their
           water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from
           all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that
           dwell therein.

26:012:020 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the
           land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

26:012:021 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:012:022 Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of
           Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision
           faileth?

26:012:023 Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this
           proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb
           in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the
           effect of every vision.

26:012:024 For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering
           divination within the house of Israel.

26:012:025 For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall
           speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for
           in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and
           will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.

26:012:026 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.

26:012:027 Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The
           vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he
           prophesieth of the times that are far off.

26:012:028 Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall
           none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I
           have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.

26:013:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:013:002 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that
           prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their
           own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;

26:013:003 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that
           follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

26:013:004 O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

26:013:005 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge
           for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of
           the LORD.

26:013:006 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD
           saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made
           others to hope that they would confirm the word.

26:013:007 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
           divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have
           not spoken?

26:013:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken
           vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,
           saith the Lord GOD.

26:013:009 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and
           that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my
           people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the
           house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of
           Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

26:013:010 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,
           Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and,
           lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:

26:013:011 Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it
           shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O
           great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.

26:013:012 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,
           Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?

26:013:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a
           stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing
           shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to
           consume it.

26:013:014 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with
           untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that
           the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall,
           and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall
           know that I am the LORD.

26:013:015 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them
           that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto
           you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;

26:013:016 To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning
           Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there
           is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.

26:013:017 Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters
           of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and
           prophesy thou against them,

26:013:018 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew
           pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of
           every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my
           people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?

26:013:019 And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley
           and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not
           die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your
           lying to my people that hear your lies?

26:013:020 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your
           pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly,
           and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls
           go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.

26:013:021 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of
           your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be
           hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

26:013:022 Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,
           whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the
           wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by
           promising him life:

26:013:023 Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:
           for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall
           know that I am the LORD.

26:014:001 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat
           before me.

26:014:002 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:014:003 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart,
           and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their
           face: should I be enquired of at all by them?

26:014:004 Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the
           Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his
           idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his
           iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the
           LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of
           his idols;

26:014:005 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart,
           because they are all estranged from me through their idols.

26:014:006 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
           GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn
           away your faces from all your abominations.

26:014:007 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
           sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and
           setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the
           stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to
           a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will
           answer him by myself:

26:014:008 And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a
           sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of
           my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

26:014:009 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I
           the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my
           hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my
           people Israel.

26:014:010 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
           punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of
           him that seeketh unto him;

26:014:011 That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me,
           neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions;
           but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith
           the Lord GOD.

26:014:012 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

26:014:013 Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing
           grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and
           will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send
           famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:

26:014:014 Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it,
           they should deliver but their own souls by their
           righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.

26:014:015 If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they
           spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through
           because of the beasts:

26:014:016 Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
           GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only
           shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

26:014:017 Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go
           through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:

26:014:018 Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
           GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they
           only shall be delivered themselves.

26:014:019 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury
           upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:

26:014:020 Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the
           Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they
           shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

26:014:021 For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four
           sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and
           the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man
           and beast?

26:014:022 Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
           brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall
           come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their
           doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I
           have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have
           brought upon it.

26:014:023 And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their
           doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause
           all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.

26:015:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:015:002 Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than
           a branch which is among the trees of the forest?

26:015:003 Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a
           pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?

26:015:004 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth
           both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet
           for any work?

26:015:005 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much
           less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath
           devoured it, and it is burned?

26:015:006 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the
           trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel,
           so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

26:015:007 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from
           one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall
           know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.

26:015:008 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed
           a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.

26:016:001 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:016:002 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

26:016:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and
           thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an
           Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.

26:016:004 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel
           was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee;
           thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.

26:016:005 None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
           compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open
           field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast
           born.

26:016:006 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own
           blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live;
           yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.

26:016:007 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and
           thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to
           excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair
           is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.

26:016:008 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy
           time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee,
           and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered
           into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou
           becamest mine.

26:016:009 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away
           thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

26:016:010 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
           badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I
           covered thee with silk.

26:016:011 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon
           thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.

26:016:012 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,
           and a beautiful crown upon thine head.

26:016:013 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment
           was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst
           eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding
           beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.

26:016:014 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty:
           for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon
           thee, saith the Lord GOD.

26:016:015 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
           harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy
           fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.

26:016:016 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
           places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon:
           the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.

26:016:017 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
           silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images
           of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,

26:016:018 And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and
           thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.

26:016:019 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and
           honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them
           for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.

26:016:020 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou
           hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them
           to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,

26:016:021 That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause
           them to pass through the fire for them?

26:016:022 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not
           remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and
           bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.

26:016:023 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto
           thee! saith the LORD GOD;)

26:016:024 That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast
           made thee an high place in every street.

26:016:025 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and
           hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet
           to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.

26:016:026 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
           neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms,
           to provoke me to anger.

26:016:027 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and
           have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto
           the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the
           Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.

26:016:028 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because
           thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with
           them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.

26:016:029 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
           Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied
           therewith.

26:016:030 How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest
           all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;

26:016:031 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every
           way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not
           been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;

26:016:032 But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers
           instead of her husband!

26:016:033 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to
           all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee
           on every side for thy whoredom.

26:016:034 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,
           whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that
           thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee,
           therefore thou art contrary.

26:016:035 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:

26:016:036 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured
           out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with
           thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by
           the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;

26:016:037 Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou
           hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with
           all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round
           about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them,
           that they may see all thy nakedness.

26:016:038 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
           blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and
           jealousy.

26:016:039 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall
           throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high
           places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall
           take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.

26:016:040 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they
           shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with
           their swords.

26:016:041 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute
           judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will
           cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also
           shalt give no hire any more.

26:016:042 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
           shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no
           more angry.

26:016:043 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but
           hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also
           will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD:
           and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine
           abominations.

26:016:044 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
           against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.

26:016:045 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and
           her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which
           lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an
           Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

26:016:046 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that
           dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth
           at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

26:016:047 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after
           their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing,
           thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.

26:016:048 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,
           she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy
           daughters.

26:016:049 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
           fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in
           her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor
           and needy.

26:016:050 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
           therefore I took them away as I saw good.

26:016:051 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
           multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast
           justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou
           hast done.

26:016:052 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame
           for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than
           they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou
           confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast
           justified thy sisters.

26:016:053 When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of
           Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her
           daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy
           captives in the midst of them:

26:016:054 That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be
           confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a
           comfort unto them.

26:016:055 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to
           their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall
           return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters
           shall return to your former estate.

26:016:056 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day
           of thy pride,

26:016:057 Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy
           reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round
           about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise
           thee round about.

26:016:058 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the
           LORD.

26:016:059 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as
           thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the
           covenant.

26:016:060 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
           of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting
           covenant.

26:016:061 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
           shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I
           will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy
           covenant.

26:016:062 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt
           know that I am the LORD:

26:016:063 That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open
           thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified
           toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.

26:017:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:017:002 Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the
           house of Israel;

26:017:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great
           wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours,
           came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:

26:017:004 He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into
           a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.

26:017:005 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a
           fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a
           willow tree.

26:017:006 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose
           branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under
           him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot
           forth sprigs.

26:017:007 There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
           feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward
           him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might
           water it by the furrows of her plantation.

26:017:008 It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might
           bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it
           might be a goodly vine.

26:017:009 Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he
           not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof,
           that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her
           spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up
           by the roots thereof.

26:017:010 Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
           utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall
           wither in the furrows where it grew.

26:017:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:017:012 Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things
           mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to
           Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes
           thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;

26:017:013 And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with
           him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the
           mighty of the land:

26:017:014 That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself
           up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.

26:017:015 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into
           Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall
           he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall
           he break the covenant, and be delivered?

26:017:016 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the
           king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and
           whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon
           he shall die.

26:017:017 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company
           make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building
           forts, to cut off many persons:

26:017:018 Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when,
           lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he
           shall not escape.

26:017:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath
           that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken,
           even it will I recompense upon his own head.

26:017:020 And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my
           snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with
           him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.

26:017:021 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
           sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all
           winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.

26:017:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest
           branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off
           from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant
           it upon an high mountain and eminent:

26:017:023 In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and
           it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly
           cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the
           shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.

26:017:024 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have
           brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have
           dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to
           flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.

26:018:001 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

26:018:002 What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of
           Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the
           children's teeth are set on edge?

26:018:003 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any
           more to use this proverb in Israel.

26:018:004 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also
           the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall
           die.

26:018:005 But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,

26:018:006 And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up
           his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath
           defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a
           menstruous woman,

26:018:007 And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor
           his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his
           bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a
           garment;

26:018:008 He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken
           any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath
           executed true judgment between man and man,

26:018:009 Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to
           deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord
           GOD.

26:018:010 If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and
           that doeth the like to any one of these things,

26:018:011 And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten
           upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,

26:018:012 Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence,
           hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to
           the idols, hath committed abomination,

26:018:013 Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he
           then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these
           abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon
           him.

26:018:014 Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins
           which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,

26:018:015 That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up
           his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled
           his neighbour's wife,

26:018:016 Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge,
           neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to
           the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,

26:018:017 That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not
           received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath
           walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of
           his father, he shall surely live.

26:018:018 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
           brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his
           people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.

26:018:019 Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
           father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right,
           and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall
           surely live.

26:018:020 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear
           the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the
           iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall
           be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon
           him.

26:018:021 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
           committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is
           lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

26:018:022 All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not
           be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done
           he shall live.

26:018:023 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith
           the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and
           live?

26:018:024 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,
           and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the
           abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his
           righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his
           trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath
           sinned, in them shall he die.

26:018:025 Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O
           house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways
           unequal?

26:018:026 When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and
           committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that
           he hath done shall he die.

26:018:027 Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness
           that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and
           right, he shall save his soul alive.

26:018:028 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his
           transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live,
           he shall not die.

26:018:029 Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not
           equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your
           ways unequal?

26:018:030 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one
           according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn
           yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not
           be your ruin.

26:018:031 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
           transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for
           why will ye die, O house of Israel?

26:018:032 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith
           the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

26:019:001 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

26:019:002 And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among
           lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.

26:019:003 And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion,
           and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.

26:019:004 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and
           they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.

26:019:005 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost,
           then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young
           lion.

26:019:006 And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young
           lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.

26:019:007 And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their
           cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by
           the noise of his roaring.

26:019:008 Then the nations set against him on every side from the
           provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in
           their pit.

26:019:009 And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the
           king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice
           should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.

26:019:010 Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters:
           she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many
           waters.

26:019:011 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare
           rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches,
           and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her
           branches.

26:019:012 But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the
           ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods
           were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.

26:019:013 And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
           ground.

26:019:014 And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath
           devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a
           sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a
           lamentation.

26:020:001 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month,
           the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of
           Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.

26:020:002 Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

26:020:003 Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto
           them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me?
           As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by
           you.

26:020:004 Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause
           them to know the abominations of their fathers:

26:020:005 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I
           chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the
           house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of
           Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the
           LORD your God;

26:020:006 In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them
           forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for
           them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all
           lands:

26:020:007 Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations
           of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of
           Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

26:020:008 But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me:
           they did not every man cast away the abominations of their
           eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I
           said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my
           anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

26:020:009 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be
           polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose
           sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth
           out of the land of Egypt.

26:020:010 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
           and brought them into the wilderness.

26:020:011 And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments,
           which if a man do, he shall even live in them.

26:020:012 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me
           and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that
           sanctify them.

26:020:013 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
           they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my
           judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and
           my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour
           out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.

26:020:014 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be
           polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them
           out.

26:020:015 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that
           I would not bring them into the land which I had given them,
           flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;

26:020:016 Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my
           statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after
           their idols.

26:020:017 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them,
           neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

26:020:018 But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not
           in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their
           judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:

26:020:019 I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my
           judgments, and do them;

26:020:020 And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me
           and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.

26:020:021 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked
           not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them,
           which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted
           my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them,
           to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.

26:020:022 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's
           sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the
           heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.

26:020:023 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I
           would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them
           through the countries;

26:020:024 Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised
           my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were
           after their fathers' idols.

26:020:025 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and
           judgments whereby they should not live;

26:020:026 And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to
           pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might
           make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am
           the LORD.

26:020:027 Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say
           unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers
           have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass
           against me.

26:020:028 For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I
           lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every
           high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there
           their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of
           their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and
           poured out there their drink offerings.

26:020:029 Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?
           And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.

26:020:030 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
           GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and
           commit ye whoredom after their abominations?

26:020:031 For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass
           through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols,
           even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house
           of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be
           enquired of by you.

26:020:032 And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that
           ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the
           countries, to serve wood and stone.

26:020:033 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and
           with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I
           rule over you:

26:020:034 And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you
           out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty
           hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.

26:020:035 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and
           there will I plead with you face to face.

26:020:036 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
           land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

26:020:037 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring
           you into the bond of the covenant:

26:020:038 And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that
           transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the
           country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the
           land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

26:020:039 As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye,
           serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will
           not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with
           your gifts, and with your idols.

26:020:040 For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of
           Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of
           Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept
           them, and there will I require your offerings, and the
           firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.

26:020:041 I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out
           from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein
           ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before
           the heathen.

26:020:042 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you
           into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I
           lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.

26:020:043 And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
           wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in
           your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.

26:020:044 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with
           you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor
           according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith
           the Lord GOD.

26:020:045 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:020:046 Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word
           toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south
           field;

26:020:047 And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD;
           Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee,
           and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry
           tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces
           from the south to the north shall be burned therein.

26:020:048 And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it
           shall not be quenched.

26:020:049 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak
           parables?

26:021:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:021:002 Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word
           toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of
           Israel,

26:021:003 And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I
           am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his
           sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the
           wicked.

26:021:004 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and
           the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his
           sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:

26:021:005 That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my
           sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.

26:021:006 Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy
           loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.

26:021:007 And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest
           thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it
           cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be
           feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be
           weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to
           pass, saith the Lord GOD.

26:021:008 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:021:009 Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A
           sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:

26:021:010 It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that
           it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the
           rod of my son, as every tree.

26:021:011 And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled:
           this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into
           the hand of the slayer.

26:021:012 Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it
           shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of
           the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy
           thigh.

26:021:013 Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the
           rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.

26:021:014 Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands
           together and let the sword be doubled the third time, the
           sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are
           slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.

26:021:015 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates,
           that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah!
           it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.

26:021:016 Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the
           left, whithersoever thy face is set.

26:021:017 I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my
           fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.

26:021:018 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

26:021:019 Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword
           of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth
           out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the
           head of the way to the city.

26:021:020 Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
           Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.

26:021:021 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at
           the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his
           arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the
           liver.

26:021:022 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint
           captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the
           voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the
           gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.

26:021:023 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their
           sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to
           remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.

26:021:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your
           iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are
           discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear;
           because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be
           taken with the hand.

26:021:025 And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,
           when iniquity shall have an end,

26:021:026 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the
           crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and
           abase him that is high.

26:021:027 I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no
           more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.

26:021:028 And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord
           GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach;
           even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the
           slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the
           glittering:

26:021:029 Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie
           unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are
           slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity
           shall have an end.

26:021:030 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee
           in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy
           nativity.

26:021:031 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow
           against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into
           the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.

26:021:032 Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the
           midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the
           LORD have spoken it.

26:022:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:022:002 Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the
           bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.

26:022:003 Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth
           blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh
           idols against herself to defile herself.

26:022:004 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and
           hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and
           thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto
           thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the
           heathen, and a mocking to all countries.

26:022:005 Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall
           mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.

26:022:006 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their
           power to shed blood.

26:022:007 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst
           of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in
           thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.

26:022:008 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my
           sabbaths.

26:022:009 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee
           they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit
           lewdness.

26:022:010 In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee
           have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.

26:022:011 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife;
           and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and
           another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's
           daughter.

26:022:012 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken
           usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy
           neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord
           GOD.

26:022:013 Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest
           gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in
           the midst of thee.

26:022:014 Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the
           days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it,
           and will do it.

26:022:015 And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee
           in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.

26:022:016 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight
           of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

26:022:017 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:022:018 Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all
           they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of
           the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.

26:022:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become
           dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of
           Jerusalem.

26:022:020 As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
           into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to
           melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury,
           and I will leave you there, and melt you.

26:022:021 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
           wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.

26:022:022 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye
           be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the
           LORD have poured out my fury upon you.

26:022:023 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:022:024 Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not
           cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

26:022:025 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof,
           like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured
           souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they
           have made her many widows in the midst thereof.

26:022:026 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
           things: they have put no difference between the holy and
           profane, neither have they shewed difference between the
           unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my
           sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

26:022:027 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the
           prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest
           gain.

26:022:028 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter,
           seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith
           the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.

26:022:029 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
           robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have
           oppressed the stranger wrongfully.

26:022:030 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
           hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I
           should not destroy it: but I found none.

26:022:031 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
           consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I
           recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.

26:023:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

26:023:002 Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:

26:023:003 And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed
           whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed,
           and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.

26:023:004 And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her
           sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters.
           Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem
           Aholibah.

26:023:005 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted
           on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,

26:023:006 Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them
           desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.

26:023:007 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that
           were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she
           doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.

26:023:008 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her
           youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her
           virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.

26:023:009 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers,
           into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

26:023:010 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
           daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous
           among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

26:023:011 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in
           her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than
           her sister in her whoredoms.

26:023:012 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and
           rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses,
           all of them desirable young men.

26:023:013 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,

26:023:014 And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men
           pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans
           pourtrayed with vermilion,

26:023:015 Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire
           upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the
           manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their
           nativity:

26:023:016 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon
           them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.

26:023:017 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
           defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with
           them, and her mind was alienated from them.

26:023:018 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:
           then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was
           alienated from her sister.

26:023:019 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance
           the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in
           the land of Egypt.

26:023:020 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the
           flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

26:023:021 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth,
           in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy
           youth.

26:023:022 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
           raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is
           alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;

26:023:023 The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and
           Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable
           young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all
           of them riding upon horses.

26:023:024 And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and
           wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set
           against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I
           will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee
           according to their judgments.

26:023:025 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
           furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine
           ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take
           thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured
           by the fire.

26:023:026 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away
           thy fair jewels.

26:023:027 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy
           whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt
           not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.

26:023:028 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into
           the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from
           whom thy mind is alienated:

26:023:029 And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away
           all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the
           nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy
           lewdness and thy whoredoms.

26:023:030 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a
           whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with
           their idols.

26:023:031 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I
           give her cup into thine hand.

26:023:032 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup
           deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in
           derision; it containeth much.

26:023:033 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup
           of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister
           Samaria.

26:023:034 Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break
           the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I
           have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

26:023:035 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten
           me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy
           lewdness and thy whoredoms.

26:023:036 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
           Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their
           abominations;

26:023:037 That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their
           hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and
           have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass
           for them through the fire, to devour them.

26:023:038 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my
           sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.

26:023:039 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then
           they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and,
           lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.

26:023:040 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,
           unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom
           thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst
           thyself with ornaments,

26:023:041 And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it,
           whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.

26:023:042 And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and
           with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the
           wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and
           beautiful crowns upon their heads.

26:023:043 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now
           commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?

26:023:044 Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that
           playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto
           Aholibah, the lewd women.

26:023:045 And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner
           of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed
           blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their
           hands.

26:023:046 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon
           them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.

26:023:047 And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch
           them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their
           daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.

26:023:048 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all
           women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.

26:023:049 And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall
           bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the
           Lord GOD.

26:024:001 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day
           of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:024:002 Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same
           day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this
           same day.

26:024:003 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto
           them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and
           also pour water into it:

26:024:004 Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the
           thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.

26:024:005 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under
           it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it
           therein.

26:024:006 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to
           the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out
           of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.

26:024:007 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top
           of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with
           dust;

26:024:008 That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have
           set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be
           covered.

26:024:009 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I
           will even make the pile for fire great.

26:024:010 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it
           well, and let the bones be burned.

26:024:011 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it
           may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be
           molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.

26:024:012 She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went
           not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.

26:024:013 In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and
           thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy
           filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon
           thee.

26:024:014 I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will
           do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will
           I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings,
           shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.

26:024:015 Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:024:016 Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine
           eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep,
           neither shall thy tears run down.

26:024:017 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire
           of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet,
           and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.

26:024:018 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife
           died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

26:024:019 And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these
           things are to us, that thou doest so?

26:024:020 Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me,
           saying,

26:024:021 Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
           Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your
           strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul
           pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left
           shall fall by the sword.

26:024:022 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips,
           nor eat the bread of men.

26:024:023 And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon
           your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away
           for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.

26:024:024 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath
           done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I
           am the Lord GOD.

26:024:025 Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take
           from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire
           of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their
           sons and their daughters,

26:024:026 That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to
           cause thee to hear it with thine ears?

26:024:027 In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped,
           and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a
           sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

26:025:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

26:025:002 Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy
           against them;

26:025:003 And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD;
           Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my
           sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of
           Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah,
           when they went into captivity;

26:025:004 Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east
           for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee,
           and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit,
           and they shall drink thy milk.

26:025:005 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites
           a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the
           LORD.

26:025:006 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine
           hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with
           all thy despite against the land of Israel;

26:025:007 Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and
           will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut
           thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out
           of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know
           that I am the LORD.

26:025:008 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,
           Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;

26:025:009 Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the
           cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory
           of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,

26:025:010 Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give
           them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered
           among the nations.

26:025:011 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know
           that I am the LORD.

26:025:012 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against
           the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly
           offended, and revenged himself upon them;

26:025:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out
           mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it;
           and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan
           shall fall by the sword.

26:025:014 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
           Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and
           according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith
           the Lord GOD.

26:025:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by
           revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to
           destroy it for the old hatred;

26:025:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out
           mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the
           Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

26:025:017 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious
           rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall
           lay my vengeance upon them.

26:026:001 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of
           the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

26:026:002 Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem,
           Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is
           turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:

26:026:003 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee,
           O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee,
           as the sea causeth his waves to come up.

26:026:004 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
           towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her
           like the top of a rock.

26:026:005 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of
           the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it
           shall become a spoil to the nations.

26:026:006 And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the
           sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

26:026:007 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus
           Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the
           north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and
           companies, and much people.

26:026:008 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and
           he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against
           thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.

26:026:009 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with
           his axes he shall break down thy towers.

26:026:010 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall
           cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the
           horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he
           shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein
           is made a breach.

26:026:011 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy
           streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong
           garrisons shall go down to the ground.

26:026:012 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of
           thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and
           destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and
           thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.

26:026:013 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the
           sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.

26:026:014 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a
           place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I
           the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

26:026:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at
           the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the
           slaughter is made in the midst of thee?

26:026:016 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their
           thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered
           garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they
           shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment,
           and be astonished at thee.

26:026:017 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to
           thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring
           men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and
           her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that
           haunt it!

26:026:018 Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the
           isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.

26:026:019 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate
           city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall
           bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover
           thee;

26:026:020 When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the
           pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the
           low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them
           that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I
           shall set glory in the land of the living;

26:026:021 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though
           thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith
           the Lord GOD.

26:027:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

26:027:002 Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;

26:027:003 And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of
           the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles,
           Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of
           perfect beauty.

26:027:004 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have
           perfected thy beauty.

26:027:005 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they
           have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.

26:027:006 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company
           of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out
           of the isles of Chittim.

26:027:007 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
           spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles
           of Elishah was that which covered thee.

26:027:008 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise
           men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.

26:027:009 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee
           thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were
           in thee to occupy thy merchandise.

26:027:010 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy
           men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they
           set forth thy comeliness.

26:027:011 The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round
           about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their
           shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty
           perfect.

26:027:012 Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all
           kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded
           in thy fairs.

26:027:013 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they
           traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.

26:027:014 They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses
           and horsemen and mules.

26:027:015 The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the
           merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present
           horns of ivory and ebony.

26:027:016 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares
           of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds,
           purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and
           agate.

26:027:017 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they
           traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey,
           and oil, and balm.

26:027:018 Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy
           making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of
           Helbon, and white wool.

26:027:019 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:
           bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.

26:027:020 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.

26:027:021 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee
           in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy
           merchants.

26:027:022 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants:
           they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with
           all precious stones, and gold.

26:027:023 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur,
           and Chilmad, were thy merchants.

26:027:024 These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue
           clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel,
           bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.

26:027:025 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou
           wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the
           seas.

26:027:026 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind
           hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.

26:027:027 Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and
           thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise,
           and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy
           company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the
           midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.

26:027:028 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.

26:027:029 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots
           of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand
           upon the land;

26:027:030 And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and
           shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads,
           they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:

26:027:031 And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird
           them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with
           bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.

26:027:032 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for
           thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus,
           like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?

26:027:033 When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many
           people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the
           multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.

26:027:034 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the
           depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in
           the midst of thee shall fall.

26:027:035 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee,
           and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled
           in their countenance.

26:027:036 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt
           be a terror, and never shalt be any more.

26:028:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

26:028:002 Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord
           GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I
           am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas;
           yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart
           as the heart of God:

26:028:003 Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that
           they can hide from thee:

26:028:004 With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
