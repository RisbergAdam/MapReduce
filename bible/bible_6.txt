           lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to
           establish Jerusalem:

11:015:005 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the
           LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded
           him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah
           the Hittite.

11:015:006 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
           of his life.

11:015:007 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

11:015:008 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
           city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

11:015:009 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned
           Asa over Judah.

11:015:010 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

11:015:011 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as
           did David his father.

11:015:012 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed
           all the idols that his fathers had made.

11:015:013 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being
           queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa
           destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.

11:015:014 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart
           was perfect with the LORD all his days.

11:015:015 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,
           and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of
           the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.

11:015:016 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
           their days.

11:015:017 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
           Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to
           Asa king of Judah.

11:015:018 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in
           the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
           the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his
           servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of
           Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at
           Damascus, saying,

11:015:019 There is a league between me and thee, and between my father
           and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of
           silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of
           Israel, that he may depart from me.

11:015:020 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
           the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote
           Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with
           all the land of Naphtali.

11:015:021 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left
           off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

11:015:022 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none
           was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the
           timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa
           built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

11:015:023 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all
           that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
           Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his
           feet.

11:015:024 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his
           son reigned in his stead.

11:015:025 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in
           the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel
           two years.

11:015:026 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
           way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
           sin.

11:015:027 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
           conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon,
           which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
           laid siege to Gibbethon.

11:015:028 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay
           him, and reigned in his stead.

11:015:029 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
           house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed,
           until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the
           LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:

11:015:030 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he
           made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the
           LORD God of Israel to anger.

11:015:031 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Israel?

11:015:032 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
           their days.

11:015:033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
           Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four
           years.

11:015:034 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
           way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
           sin.

11:016:001 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani
           against Baasha, saying,

11:016:002 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee
           prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way
           of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke
           me to anger with their sins;

11:016:003 Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the
           posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house
           of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

11:016:004 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and
           him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air
           eat.

11:016:005 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
           might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
           the kings of Israel?

11:016:006 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah:
           and Elah his son reigned in his stead.

11:016:007 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani
           came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his
           house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the
           LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in
           being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.

11:016:008 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah
           the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

11:016:009 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
           against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in
           the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.

11:016:010 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty
           and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his
           stead.

11:016:011 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
           on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left
           him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his
           kinsfolks, nor of his friends.

11:016:012 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to
           the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu
           the prophet.

11:016:013 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by
           which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in
           provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

11:016:014 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Israel?

11:016:015 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
           reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped
           against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

11:016:016 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
           conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel
           made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day
           in the camp.

11:016:017 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
           they besieged Tirzah.

11:016:018 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
           that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt
           the king's house over him with fire, and died.

11:016:019 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
           LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which
           he did, to make Israel to sin.

11:016:020 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
           wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
           the kings of Israel?

11:016:021 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of
           the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king;
           and half followed Omri.

11:016:022 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
           that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri
           reigned.

11:016:023 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
           to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in
           Tirzah.

11:016:024 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
           silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city
           which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill,
           Samaria.

11:016:025 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
           than all that were before him.

11:016:026 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
           in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the
           LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

11:016:027 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
           that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the
           chronicles of the kings of Israel?

11:016:028 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and
           Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

11:016:029 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
           Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of
           Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

11:016:030 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD
           above all that were before him.

11:016:031 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him
           to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took
           to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians,
           and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.

11:016:032 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which
           he had built in Samaria.

11:016:033 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD
           God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were
           before him.

11:016:034 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
           foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the
           gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word
           of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

11:017:001 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
           said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom
           I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but
           according to my word.

11:017:002 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

11:017:003 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by
           the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

11:017:004 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I
           have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

11:017:005 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he
           went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

11:017:006 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
           bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

11:017:007 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
           because there had been no rain in the land.

11:017:008 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

11:017:009 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and
           dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to
           sustain thee.

11:017:010 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the
           gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering
           of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray
           thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.

11:017:011 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
           Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.

11:017:012 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake,
           but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
           cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go
           in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and
           die.

11:017:013 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast
           said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it
           unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.

11:017:014 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal
           shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until
           the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

11:017:015 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
           she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.

11:017:016 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of
           oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
           Elijah.

11:017:017 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
           woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness
           was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.

11:017:018 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
           man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to
           remembrance, and to slay my son?

11:017:019 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of
           her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and
           laid him upon his own bed.

11:017:020 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
           also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
           slaying her son?

11:017:021 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried
           unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this
           child's soul come into him again.

11:017:022 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
           child came into him again, and he revived.

11:017:023 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
           chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and
           Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.

11:017:024 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art
           a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is
           truth.

11:018:001 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
           came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself
           unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.

11:018:002 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a
           sore famine in Samaria.

11:018:003 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
           (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:

11:018:004 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
           that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty
           in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)

11:018:005 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all
           fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may
           find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose
           not all the beasts.

11:018:006 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
           Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by
           himself.

11:018:007 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
           knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my
           lord Elijah?

11:018:008 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah
           is here.

11:018:009 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver
           thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?

11:018:010 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,
           whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they
           said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and
           nation, that they found thee not.

11:018:011 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
           here.

11:018:012 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee,
           that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know
           not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find
           thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from
           my youth.

11:018:013 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
           prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's
           prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and
           water?

11:018:014 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
           here: and he shall slay me.

11:018:015 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
           stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.

11:018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
           meet Elijah.

11:018:017 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
           him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

11:018:018 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
           father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of
           the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.

11:018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
           Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and
           the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at
           Jezebel's table.

11:018:020 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
           prophets together unto mount Carmel.

11:018:021 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt
           ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but
           if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a
           word.

11:018:022 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a
           prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and
           fifty men.

11:018:023 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose
           one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it
           on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other
           bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:

11:018:024 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the
           name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him
           be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well
           spoken.

11:018:025 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
           bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many;
           and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.

11:018:026 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they
           dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even
           until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice,
           nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which
           was made.

11:018:027 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and
           said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he
           is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he
           sleepeth, and must be awaked.

11:018:028 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
           with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

11:018:029 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
           until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that
           there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that
           regarded.

11:018:030 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And
           all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar
           of the LORD that was broken down.

11:018:031 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
           tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD
           came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:

11:018:032 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD:
           and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would
           contain two measures of seed.

11:018:033 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces,
           and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with
           water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

11:018:034 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
           time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the
           third time.

11:018:035 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
           trench also with water.

11:018:036 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
           sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD
           God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day
           that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and
           that I have done all these things at thy word.

11:018:037 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
           art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back
           again.

11:018:038 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
           sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and
           licked up the water that was in the trench.

11:018:039 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and
           they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.

11:018:040 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
           one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought
           them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.

11:018:041 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for
           there is a sound of abundance of rain.

11:018:042 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
           top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and
           put his face between his knees,

11:018:043 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And
           he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he
           said, Go again seven times.

11:018:044 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
           there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's
           hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot,
           and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.

11:018:045 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was
           black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And
           Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.

11:018:046 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
           loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

11:019:001 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how
           he had slain all the prophets with the sword.

11:019:002 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
           gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the
           life of one of them by to morrow about this time.

11:019:003 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and
           came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his
           servant there.

11:019:004 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and
           came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for
           himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O
           LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.

11:019:005 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
           angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.

11:019:006 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the
           coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and
           drink, and laid him down again.

11:019:007 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and
           touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is
           too great for thee.

11:019:008 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
           of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount
           of God.

11:019:009 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and,
           behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto
           him, What doest thou here, Elijah?

11:019:010 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
           hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
           thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the
           sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
           take it away.

11:019:011 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the
           LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong
           wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before
           the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind
           an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:

11:019:012 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the
           fire: and after the fire a still small voice.

11:019:013 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face
           in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of
           the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said,
           What doest thou here, Elijah?

11:019:014 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
           hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy
           covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets
           with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my
           life, to take it away.

11:019:015 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
           wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to
           be king over Syria:

11:019:016 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over
           Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt
           thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.

11:019:017 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
           Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword
           of Jehu shall Elisha slay.

11:019:018 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
           which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not
           kissed him.

11:019:019 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
           who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he
           with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his
           mantle upon him.

11:019:020 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me,
           I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
           follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what
           have I done to thee?

11:019:021 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and
           slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the
           oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he
           arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

11:020:001 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:
           and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and
           chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred
           against it.

11:020:002 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,
           and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,

11:020:003 Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy
           children, even the goodliest, are mine.

11:020:004 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
           according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.

11:020:005 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh
           Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou
           shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and
           thy children;

11:020:006 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this
           time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy
           servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in
           thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.

11:020:007 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and
           said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief:
           for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for
           my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.

11:020:008 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken
           not unto him, nor consent.

11:020:009 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my
           lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at
           the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the
           messengers departed, and brought him word again.

11:020:010 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,
           and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for
           handfuls for all the people that follow me.

11:020:011 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not
           him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that
           putteth it off.

11:020:012 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he
           was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said
           unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set
           themselves in array against the city.

11:020:013 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
           saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great
           multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day;
           and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

11:020:014 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even
           by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he
           said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.

11:020:015 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the
           provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after
           them he numbered all the people, even all the children of
           Israel, being seven thousand.

11:020:016 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself
           drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two
           kings that helped him.

11:020:017 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
           first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There
           are men come out of Samaria.

11:020:018 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
           alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.

11:020:019 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
           the city, and the army which followed them.

11:020:020 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
           Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on
           an horse with the horsemen.

11:020:021 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
           chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

11:020:022 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,
           Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for
           at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up
           against thee.

11:020:023 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their
           gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than
           we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we
           shall be stronger than they.

11:020:024 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
           place, and put captains in their rooms:

11:020:025 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost,
           horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight
           against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger
           than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.

11:020:026 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
           numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against
           Israel.

11:020:027 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all
           present, and went against them: and the children of Israel
           pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the
           Syrians filled the country.

11:020:028 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of
           Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians
           have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of
           the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude
           into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

11:020:029 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so
           it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the
           children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand
           footmen in one day.

11:020:030 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall
           fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.
           And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner
           chamber.

11:020:031 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that
           the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I
           pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our
           heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will
           save thy life.

11:020:032 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on
           their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy
           servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said,
           Is he yet alive? he is my brother.

11:020:033 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would
           come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy
           brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then
           Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into
           the chariot.

11:020:034 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took
           from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets
           for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said
           Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a
           covenant with him, and sent him away.

11:020:035 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
           neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And
           the man refused to smite him.

11:020:036 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice
           of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a
           lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him,
           a lion found him, and slew him.

11:020:037 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.
           And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.

11:020:038 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
           and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

11:020:039 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he
           said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and,
           behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and
           said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall
           thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of
           silver.

11:020:040 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And
           the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be;
           thyself hast decided it.

11:020:041 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the
           king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.

11:020:042 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast
           let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter
           destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy
           people for his people.

11:020:043 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,
           and came to Samaria.

11:021:001 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the
           Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the
           palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

11:021:002 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that
           I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto
           my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than
           it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of
           it in money.

11:021:003 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should
           give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.

11:021:004 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of
           the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he
           had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.
           And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,
           and would eat no bread.

11:021:005 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is
           thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?

11:021:006 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the
           Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money;
           or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard
           for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.

11:021:007 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
           kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart
           be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the
           Jezreelite.

11:021:008 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his
           seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles
           that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.

11:021:009 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
           Naboth on high among the people:

11:021:010 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness
           against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.
           And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.

11:021:011 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who
           were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto
           them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent
           unto them.

11:021:012 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the
           people.

11:021:013 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before
           him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against
           Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did
           blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of
           the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.

11:021:014 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
           dead.

11:021:015 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was
           stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take
           possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he
           refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but
           dead.

11:021:016 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
           that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the
           Jezreelite, to take possession of it.

11:021:017 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

11:021:018 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in
           Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he
           is gone down to possess it.

11:021:019 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,
           Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt
           speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place
           where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy
           blood, even thine.

11:021:020 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
           he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself
           to work evil in the sight of the LORD.

11:021:021 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
           posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against
           the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,

11:021:022 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son
           of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for
           the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and
           made Israel to sin.

11:021:023 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
           Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

11:021:024 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him
           that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.

11:021:025 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to
           work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his
           wife stirred up.

11:021:026 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to
           all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before
           the children of Israel.

11:021:027 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent
           his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and
           lay in sackcloth, and went softly.

11:021:028 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

11:021:029 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he
           humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his
           days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his
           house.

11:022:001 And they continued three years without war between Syria and
           Israel.

11:022:002 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the
           king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.

11:022:003 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
           Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out
           of the hand of the king of Syria?

11:022:004 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle
           to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I
           am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy
           horses.

11:022:005 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
           thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

11:022:006 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
           four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against
           Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
           up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

11:022:007 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
           besides, that we might enquire of him?

11:022:008 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
           man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the
           LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning
           me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

11:022:009 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
           hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.

11:022:010 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
           each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place
           in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
           prophesied before them.

11:022:011 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and
           he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the
           Syrians, until thou have consumed them.

11:022:012 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
           Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
           the king's hand.

11:022:013 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto
           him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare
           good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee,
           be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.

11:022:014 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto
           me, that will I speak.

11:022:015 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
           shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we
           forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD
           shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

11:022:016 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee
           that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name
           of the LORD?

11:022:017 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as
           sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have
           no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.

11:022:018 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
           thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?

11:022:019 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw
           the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven
           standing by him on his right hand and on his left.

11:022:020 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up
           and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and
           another said on that manner.

11:022:021 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
           said, I will persuade him.

11:022:022 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
           forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
           prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail
           also: go forth, and do so.

11:022:023 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
           mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
           concerning thee.

11:022:024 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
           on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD
           from me to speak unto thee?

11:022:025 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when
           thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

11:022:026 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
           unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
           son;

11:022:027 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
           and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
           affliction, until I come in peace.

11:022:028 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD
           hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every
           one of you.

11:022:029 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
           up to Ramothgilead.

11:022:030 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
           myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.
           And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the
           battle.

11:022:031 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains
           that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with
           small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.

11:022:032 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
           Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.
           And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat
           cried out.

11:022:033 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots
           perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned
           back from pursuing him.

11:022:034 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
           of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said
           unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me
           out of the host; for I am wounded.

11:022:035 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up
           in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the
           blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.

11:022:036 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
           going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and
           every man to his own country.

11:022:037 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
           the king in Samaria.

11:022:038 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the
           dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour;
           according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.

11:022:039 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
           ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built,
           are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Israel?

11:022:040 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in
           his stead.

11:022:041 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in
           the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

11:022:042 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to
           reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And
           his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

11:022:043 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not
           aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the
           LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for
           the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.

11:022:044 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

11:022:045 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
           shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of
           the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

11:022:046 And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days
           of his father Asa, he took out of the land.

11:022:047 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.

11:022:048 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold:
           but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.

11:022:049 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
           servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat
           would not.

11:022:050 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
           his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his
           son reigned in his stead.

11:022:051 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
           the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned
           two years over Israel.

11:022:052 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
           way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the
           way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:

11:022:053 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger
           the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had
           done.

Book 12        2 Kings

12:001:001 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

12:001:002 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
           that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and
           said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron
           whether I shall recover of this disease.

12:001:003 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise,
           go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say
           unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel,
           that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?

12:001:004 Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down
           from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
           And Elijah departed.

12:001:005 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto
           them, Why are ye now turned back?

12:001:006 And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and
           said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and
           say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is
           not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub
           the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that
           bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

12:001:007 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up
           to meet you, and told you these words?

12:001:008 And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a
           girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah
           the Tishbite.

12:001:009 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
           And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an
           hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath
           said, Come down.

12:001:010 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be
           a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume
           thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and
           consumed him and his fifty.

12:001:011 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
           fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus
           hath the king said, Come down quickly.

12:001:012 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God,
           let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy
           fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed
           him and his fifty.

12:001:013 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
           And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on
           his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him,
           O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these
           fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.

12:001:014 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
           captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore
           let my life now be precious in thy sight.

12:001:015 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him:
           be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him
           unto the king.

12:001:016 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou
           hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron,
           is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his
           word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which
           thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

12:001:017 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had
           spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of
           Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had
           no son.

12:001:018 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

12:002:001 And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into
           heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from
           Gilgal.

12:002:002 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
           LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the
           LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So
           they went down to Bethel.

12:002:003 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
           Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
           take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I
           know it; hold ye your peace.

12:002:004 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for
           the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD
           liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they
           came to Jericho.

12:002:005 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to
           Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
           take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered,
           Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.

12:002:006 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the
           LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth,
           and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two
           went on.

12:002:007 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to
           view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.

12:002:008 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote
           the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that
           they two went over on dry ground.

12:002:009 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah
           said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be
           taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a
           double portion of thy spirit be upon me.

12:002:010 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if
           thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto
           thee; but if not, it shall not be so.

12:002:011 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
           behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,
           and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a
           whirlwind into heaven.

12:002:012 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
           chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no
           more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in
           two pieces.

12:002:013 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
           went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

12:002:014 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote
           the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and
           when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and
           thither: and Elisha went over.

12:002:015 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at
           Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on
           Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
           ground before him.

12:002:016 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants
           fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy
           master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken
           him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.
           And he said, Ye shall not send.

12:002:017 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.
           They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but
           found him not.

12:002:018 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,)
           he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

12:002:019 And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee,
           the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but
           the water is naught, and the ground barren.

12:002:020 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And
           they brought it to him.

12:002:021 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the
           salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed
           these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or
           barren land.

12:002:022 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the
           saying of Elisha which he spake.

12:002:023 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up
           by the way, there came forth little children out of the city,
           and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go
           up, thou bald head.

12:002:024 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
           name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of
           the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.

12:002:025 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
           returned to Samaria.

12:003:001 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in
           Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and
           reigned twelve years.

12:003:002 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
           father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal
           that his father had made.

12:003:003 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
           Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

12:003:004 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto
           the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred
           thousand rams, with the wool.

12:003:005 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
           rebelled against the king of Israel.

12:003:006 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and
           numbered all Israel.

12:003:007 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
           The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with
           me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as
           thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy
           horses.

12:003:008 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The
           way through the wilderness of Edom.

12:003:009 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the
           king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days'
           journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the
           cattle that followed them.

12:003:010 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called
           these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of
           Moab!

12:003:011 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,
           that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of
           Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of
           Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.

12:003:012 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
           king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down
           to him.

12:003:013 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do
           with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the
           prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him,
           Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to
           deliver them into the hand of Moab.

12:003:014 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
           stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of
           Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee,
           nor see thee.

12:003:015 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
           minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.

12:003:016 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of
           ditches.

12:003:017 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall
           ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that
           ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

12:003:018 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he
           will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

12:003:019 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city,
           and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water,
           and mar every good piece of land with stones.

12:003:020 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
           offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom,
           and the country was filled with water.

12:003:021 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to
           fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on
           armour, and upward, and stood in the border.

12:003:022 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon
           the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as
           red as blood:

12:003:023 And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and
           they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the
           spoil.

12:003:024 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
           up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but
           they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.

12:003:025 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land
           cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all
           the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in
           Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers
           went about it, and smote it.

12:003:026 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
           him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to
           break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.

12:003:027 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
           stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And
           there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed
           from him, and returned to their own land.

12:004:001 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of
           the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is
           dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and
           the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be
           bondmen.

12:004:002 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me,
           what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath
           not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.

12:004:003 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
           neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

12:004:004 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee
           and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels,
           and thou shalt set aside that which is full.

12:004:005 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
           sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.

12:004:006 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
           unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,
           There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.

12:004:007 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell
           the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of
           the rest.

12:004:008 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was
           a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it
           was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat
           bread.

12:004:009 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that
           this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

12:004:010 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and
           let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and
           a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he
           shall turn in thither.

12:004:011 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
           the chamber, and lay there.

12:004:012 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And
           when he had called her, she stood before him.

12:004:013 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
           careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for
           thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the
           captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own
           people.

12:004:014 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
           answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

12:004:015 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood
           in the door.

12:004:016 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
           thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man
           of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

12:004:017 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
           Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.

12:004:018 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went
           out to his father to the reapers.

12:004:019 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to
           a lad, Carry him to his mother.

12:004:020 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he
           sat on her knees till noon, and then died.

12:004:021 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God,
           and shut the door upon him, and went out.

12:004:022 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray
           thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may
           run to the man of God, and come again.

12:004:023 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is
           neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.

12:004:024 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and
           go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.

12:004:025 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And
           it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he
           said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:

12:004:026 Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it
           well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with
           the child? And she answered, It is well:

12:004:027 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught
           him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And
           the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed
           within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not
           told me.

12:004:028 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say,
           Do not deceive me?

12:004:029 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff
           in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute
           him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay
           my staff upon the face of the child.

12:004:030 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as
           thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and
           followed her.

12:004:031 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
           face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.
           Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The
           child is not awaked.

12:004:032 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
           dead, and laid upon his bed.

12:004:033 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
           prayed unto the LORD.

12:004:034 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon
           his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his
           hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of
           the child waxed warm.

12:004:035 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
           up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed
           seven times, and the child opened his eyes.

12:004:036 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
           called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take
           up thy son.

12:004:037 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to
           the ground, and took up her son, and went out.

12:004:038 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
           land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him:
           and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe
           pottage for the sons of the prophets.

12:004:039 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a
           wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and
           came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew
           them not.

12:004:040 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
           they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and
           said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they
           could not eat thereof.

12:004:041 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and
           he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there
           was no harm in the pot.

12:004:042 And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of
           God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and
           full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto
           the people, that they may eat.

12:004:043 And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an
           hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may
           eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave
           thereof.

12:004:044 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
           according to the word of the LORD.

12:005:001 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a
           great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the
           LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty
           man in valour, but he was a leper.

12:005:002 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought
           away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she
           waited on Naaman's wife.

12:005:003 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with
           the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of
           his leprosy.

12:005:004 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said
           the maid that is of the land of Israel.

12:005:005 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a
           letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with
           him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold,
           and ten changes of raiment.

12:005:006 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now
           when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith
           sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him
           of his leprosy.

12:005:007 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the
           letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill
           and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover
           a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see
           how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

12:005:008 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the
           king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king,
           saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now
           to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

12:005:009 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood
           at the door of the house of Elisha.

12:005:010 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
           Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee,
           and thou shalt be clean.

12:005:011 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I
           thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on
           the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the
           place, and recover the leper.

12:005:012 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all
           the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So
           he turned and went away in a rage.

12:005:013 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
           father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing,
           wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he
           saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?

12:005:014 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
           according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came
           again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

12:005:015 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
           came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know
           that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now
           therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.

12:005:016 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will
           receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.

12:005:017 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given
           to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant
           will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice
           unto other gods, but unto the LORD.

12:005:018 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master
           goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he
           leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon:
           when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon
           thy servant in this thing.

12:005:019 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a
           little way.

12:005:020 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
           Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not
           receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD
           liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.

12:005:021 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him
           running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet
           him, and said, Is all well?

12:005:022 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying,
           Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two
           young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee,
           a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.

12:005:023 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged
           him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two
           changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants;
           and they bare them before him.

12:005:024 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand,
           and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and
           they departed.

12:005:025 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said
           unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant
           went no whither.

12:005:026 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the
           man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time
           to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and
           vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
           maidservants?

12:005:027 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and
           unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a
           leper as white as snow.

12:006:001 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
           place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.

12:006:002 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every
           man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may
           dwell. And he answered, Go ye.

12:006:003 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy
           servants. And he answered, I will go.

12:006:004 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut
           down wood.

12:006:005 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the
           water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was
           borrowed.

12:006:006 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
           place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and
           the iron did swim.

12:006:007 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his
           hand, and took it.

12:006:008 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
           with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be
           my camp.

12:006:009 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying,
           Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the
           Syrians are come down.

12:006:010 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
           told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once
           nor twice.

12:006:011 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for
           this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them,
           Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?

12:006:012 And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but
           Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of
           Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.

12:006:013 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
           him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.

12:006:014 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great
           host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.

12:006:015 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and
           gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with
           horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my
           master! how shall we do?

12:006:016 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more
           than they that be with them.

12:006:017 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
           that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young
           man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses
           and chariots of fire round about Elisha.

12:006:018 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD,
           and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And
           he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

12:006:019 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is
           this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom
           ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.

12:006:020 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
           Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may
           see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and,
           behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.

12:006:021 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
           father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

12:006:022 And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou
           smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and
           with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may
           eat and drink, and go to their master.

12:006:023 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had
           eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their
           master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of
           Israel.

12:006:024 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria
           gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

12:006:025 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
           besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces
           of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for
           five pieces of silver.

12:006:026 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there
           cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.

12:006:027 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help
           thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?

12:006:028 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
           answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may
           eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.

12:006:029 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on
           the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath
           hid her son.

12:006:030 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the
           woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the
           wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth
           within upon his flesh.

12:006:031 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
           Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.

12:006:032 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and
           the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger
           came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a
           murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the
           messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the
           door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?

12:006:033 And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came
           down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD;
           what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

12:007:001 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the
           LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour
           be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,
           in the gate of Samaria.

12:007:002 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of
           God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in
           heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt
           see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

12:007:003 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the
           gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we
           die?

12:007:004 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in
           the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we
           die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of
           the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they
           kill us, we shall but die.

12:007:005 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
           Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the
           camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

12:007:006 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise
           of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great
           host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel
           hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings
           of the Egyptians, to come upon us.

12:007:007 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
           tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it
           was, and fled for their life.

12:007:008 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp,
           they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried
           thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and
           came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence
           also, and went and hid it.

12:007:009 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a
           day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till
           the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now
           therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.

12:007:010 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they
           told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and,
           behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but
           horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.

12:007:011 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's
           house within.

12:007:012 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I
           will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know
           that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to
           hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of
           the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.

12:007:013 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I
           pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in
           the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel
           that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the
           multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us
           send and see.

12:007:014 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent
           after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

12:007:015 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
           full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away
           in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the
           king.

12:007:016 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.
           So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two
           measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the
           LORD.

12:007:017 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to
           have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in
           the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake
           when the king came down to him.

12:007:018 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
           saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of
           fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in
           the gate of Samaria:

12:007:019 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,
           if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing
           be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
           but shalt not eat thereof.

12:007:020 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in
           the gate, and he died.

12:008:001 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
           life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and
           sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath
           called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land
           seven years.

12:008:002 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of
           God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the
           land of the Philistines seven years.

12:008:003 And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman
           returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went
           forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.

12:008:004 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
           saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha
           hath done.

12:008:005 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
           restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose
           son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house
           and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is
           the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.

12:008:006 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
           appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that
           was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that
           she left the land, even until now.

12:008:007 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria
           was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come
           hither.

12:008:008 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand,
           and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him,
           saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

12:008:009 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even
           of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and
           came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of
           Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this
           disease?

12:008:010 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest
           certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he
           shall surely die.

12:008:011 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was
           ashamed: and the man of God wept.

12:008:012 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because
           I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel:
           their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men
           wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children,
           and rip up their women with child.

12:008:013 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he
           should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath
           shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.

12:008:014 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said
           to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me
           that thou shouldest surely recover.

12:008:015 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
           and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he
           died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.

12:008:016 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
           Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je
           hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.

12:008:017 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
           reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

12:008:018 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the
           house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he
           did evil in the sight of the LORD.

12:008:019 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's
           sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his
           children.

12:008:020 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and
           made a king over themselves.

12:008:021 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and
           he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him
           about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled
           into their tents.

12:008:022 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
           Then Libnah revolted at the same time.

12:008:023 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:008:024 And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in
           his stead.

12:008:025 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel
           did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.

12:008:026 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign;
           and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
           was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.

12:008:027 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in
           the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was
           the son in law of the house of Ahab.

12:008:028 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against
           Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded
           Joram.

12:008:029 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
           which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought
           against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram
           king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in
           Jezreel, because he was sick.

12:009:001 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the
           prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this
           box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:

12:009:002 And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
           Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise
           up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;

12:009:003 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say,
           Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
           Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.

12:009:004 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
           Ramothgilead.

12:009:005 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were
           sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And
           Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O
           captain.

12:009:006 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil
           on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
           Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD,
           even over Israel.

12:009:007 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
           avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of
           all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.

12:009:008 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off
           from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is
           shut up and left in Israel:

12:009:009 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam
           the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of
           Ahijah:

12:009:010 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and
           there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and
           fled.

12:009:011 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said
           unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?
           And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

12:009:012 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
           thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have
           anointed thee king over Israel.

12:009:013 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it
           under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets,
           saying, Jehu is king.

12:009:014 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
           against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all
           Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.

12:009:015 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the
           wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with
           Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds,
           then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to
           tell it in Jezreel.

12:009:016 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
           there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.

12:009:017 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he
           spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a
           company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet
           them, and let him say, Is it peace?

12:009:018 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus
           saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to
           do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told,
           saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.

12:009:019 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them,
           and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered,
           What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.

12:009:020 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and
           cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu
           the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.

12:009:021 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready.
           And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out,
           each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met
           him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

12:009:022 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
           peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the
           whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so
           many?

12:009:023 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,
           There is treachery, O Ahaziah.

12:009:024 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
           between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he
           sunk down in his chariot.

12:009:025 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
           the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for
           remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab
           his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;

12:009:026 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the
           blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in
           this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him
           into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.

12:009:027 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the
           way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and
           said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the
           going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo,
           and died there.

12:009:028 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
           buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of
           David.

12:009:029 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began
           Ahaziah to reign over Judah.

12:009:030 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and
           she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a
           window.

12:009:031 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,
           who slew his master?

12:009:032 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on
           my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three
           eunuchs.

12:009:033 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some
           of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and
           he trode her under foot.

12:009:034 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go,
           see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's
           daughter.

12:009:035 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than
           the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

12:009:036 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is
           the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the
           Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the
           flesh of Jezebel:

12:009:037 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of
           the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not
           say, This is Jezebel.

12:010:001 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters,
           and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the
           elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,

12:010:002 Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's
           sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses,
           a fenced city also, and armour;

12:010:003 Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and
           set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's
           house.

12:010:004 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings
           stood not before him: how then shall we stand?

12:010:005 And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city,
           the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to
           Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou
           shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is
           good in thine eyes.

12:010:006 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye
           be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the
           heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel
           by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy
           persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought
           them up.

12:010:007 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they
           took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their
           heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.

12:010:008 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
           brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them
           in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.

12:010:009 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and
           stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I
           conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all
           these?

12:010:010 Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the
           word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of
           Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his
           servant Elijah.

12:010:011 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in
           Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his
           priests, until he left him none remaining.

12:010:012 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was
           at the shearing house in the way,

12:010:013 Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said,
           Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah;
           and we go down to salute the children of the king and the
           children of the queen.

12:010:014 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and
           slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty
           men; neither left he any of them.

12:010:015 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the
           son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said
           to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?
           And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand.
           And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the
           chariot.

12:010:016 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So
           they made him ride in his chariot.

12:010:017 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto
           Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the
           saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.

12:010:018 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,
           Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.

12:010:019 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
           servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have
           a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting,
           he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent
           that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.

12:010:020 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
           proclaimed it.

12:010:021 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of
           Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And
           they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was
           full from one end to another.

12:010:022 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth
           vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them
           forth vestments.

12:010:023 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house
           of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and
           look that there be here with you none of the servants of the
           LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.

12:010:024 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
           Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the
           men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that
           letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.

12:010:025 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering
           the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the
           captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they
           smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the
           captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of
           Baal.

12:010:026 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal,
           and burned them.

12:010:027 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the
           house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.

12:010:028 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

12:010:029 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
           Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the
           golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.

12:010:030 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
           executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto
           the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy
           children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of
           Israel.

12:010:031 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
           Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins
           of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.

12:010:032 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael
           smote them in all the coasts of Israel;

12:010:033 From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and
           the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by
           the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

12:010:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
           his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
           of the kings of Israel?

12:010:035 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in
           Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

12:010:036 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was
           twenty and eight years.

12:011:001 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
           dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

12:011:002 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
           took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the
           king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and
           his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not
           slain.

12:011:003 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.
           And Athaliah did reign over the land.

12:011:004 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
           hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to
           him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them,
           and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed
           them the king's son.

12:011:005 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
           do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall
           even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;

12:011:006 And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part
           at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of
           the house, that it be not broken down.

12:011:007 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even
           they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the
           king.

12:011:008 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
           weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let
           him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as
           he cometh in.

12:011:009 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
           that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man
           his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that
           should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

12:011:010 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
           David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the
           LORD.

12:011:011 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
           round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to
           the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the
           temple.

12:011:012 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon
           him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and
           anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save
           the king.

12:011:013 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
           people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.

12:011:014 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as
           the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the
           king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with
           trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason,
           Treason.

12:011:015 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the
           hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have
           her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill
           with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain
           in the house of the LORD.

12:011:016 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the
           which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she
           slain.

12:011:017 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
           the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the
           king also and the people.

12:011:018 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal,
           and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in
           pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before
           the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house
           of the LORD.

12:011:019 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and
           the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought
           down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way
           of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on
           the throne of the kings.

12:011:020 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
           quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's
           house.

12:011:021 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.

12:012:001 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
           years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
           Zibiah of Beersheba.

12:012:002 And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
           all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

12:012:003 But the high places were not taken away: the people still
           sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

12:012:004 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the
           dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD,
           even the money of every one that passeth the account, the
           money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh
           into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,

12:012:005 Let the priests take it to them, every man of his
           acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,
           wheresoever any breach shall be found.

12:012:006 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king
           Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the
           house.

12:012:007 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the
           other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the
           breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of
           your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the
           house.

12:012:008 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the
           people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.

12:012:009 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the
           lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as
           one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that
           kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into
           the house of the LORD.

12:012:010 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the
           chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and
           they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the
           house of the LORD.

12:012:011 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them
           that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the
           LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders,
           that wrought upon the house of the LORD,

12:012:012 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and
           hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD,
           and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.

12:012:013 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of
           silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or
           vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the
           house of the LORD:

12:012:014 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the
           house of the LORD.

12:012:015 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
           delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt
           faithfully.

12:012:016 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the
           house of the LORD: it was the priests'.

12:012:017 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath,
           and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.

12:012:018 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
           Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of
           Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the
           gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD,
           and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria:
           and he went away from Jerusalem.

12:012:019 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:012:020 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash
           in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.

12:012:021 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
           Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried
           him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:013:001 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah
           king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over
           Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.

12:013:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and
           followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made
           Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

12:013:003 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
           delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into
           the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.

12:013:004 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto
           him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of
           Syria oppressed them.

12:013:005 (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out
           from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel
           dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.

12:013:006 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
           Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there
           remained the grove also in Samaria.)

12:013:007 Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty
           horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the
           king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the
           dust by threshing.

12:013:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
           his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
           of the kings of Israel?

12:013:009 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in
           Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

12:013:010 In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
           Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria,
           and reigned sixteen years.

12:013:011 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he
           departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
           who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.

12:013:012 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and
           his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,
           are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Israel?

12:013:013 And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his
           throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of
           Israel.

12:013:014 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.
           And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over
           his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of
           Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

12:013:015 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took
           unto him bow and arrows.

12:013:016 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the
           bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands
           upon the king's hands.

12:013:017 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then
           Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the
           LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria:
           for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have
           consumed them.

12:013:018 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said
           unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote
           thrice, and stayed.

12:013:019 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou
           shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou
           smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou
           shalt smite Syria but thrice.

12:013:020 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
           Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

12:013:021 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,
           they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the
           sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and
           touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his
           feet.

12:013:022 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
           Jehoahaz.

12:013:023 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on
           them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with
           Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither
           cast he them from his presence as yet.

12:013:024 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in
           his stead.

12:013:025 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
           Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out
           of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did
           Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

12:014:001 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
           reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.

12:014:002 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
           reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

12:014:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet
           not like David his father: he did according to all things as
           Joash his father did.

12:014:004 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
           did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.

12:014:005 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in
           his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king
           his father.

12:014:006 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
           that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein
           the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to
           death for the children, nor the children be put to death for
           the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own
           sin.

12:014:007 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
           Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this
           day.

12:014:008 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz
           son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one
           another in the face.

12:014:009 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
           saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
           was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
           and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
           trode down the thistle.

12:014:010 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted
           thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest
           thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou,
           and Judah with thee?

12:014:011 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
           went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another
           in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

12:014:012 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
           every man to their tents.

12:014:013 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
           of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to
           Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate
           of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

12:014:014 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
           were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of
           the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

12:014:015 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his
           might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they
           not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Israel?

12:014:016 And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria
           with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his
           stead.

12:014:017 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
           death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

12:014:018 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in
           the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

12:014:019 Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he
           fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew
           him there.

12:014:020 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
           with his fathers in the city of David.

12:014:021 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen
           years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

12:014:022 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
           slept with his fathers.

12:014:023 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of
           Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign
           in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.

12:014:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
           departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
           who made Israel to sin.

12:014:025 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath
           unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD
           God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant
           Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of
           Gathhepher.

12:014:026 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very
           bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any
           helper for Israel.

12:014:027 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of
           Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of
           Jeroboam the son of Joash.

12:014:028 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
           his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and
           Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

12:014:029 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of
           Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

12:015:001 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel
           began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.

12:015:002 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he
           reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

12:015:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his father Amaziah had done;

12:015:004 Save that the high places were not removed: the people
           sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.

12:015:005 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the
           day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the
           king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land.

12:015:006 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:015:007 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with
           his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned
           in his stead.

12:015:008 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
           Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six
           months.

12:015:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
           his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of
           Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

12:015:010 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote
           him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

12:015:011 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

12:015:012 This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu,
           saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the
           fourth generation. And so it came to pass.

12:015:013 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
           thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full
           month in Samaria.

12:015:014 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
           Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and
           slew him, and reigned in his stead.

12:015:015 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which
           he made, behold, they are written in the book of the
           chronicles of the kings of Israel.

12:015:016 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
           coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him,
           therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were
           with child he ripped up.

12:015:017 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
           Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten
           years in Samaria.

12:015:018 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
           departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
           Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

12:015:019 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem
           gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be
           with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

12:015:020 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the
           mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to
           give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned
           back, and stayed not there in the land.

12:015:021 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Israel?

12:015:022 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:015:023 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son
           of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned
           two years.

12:015:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
           departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
           made Israel to sin.

12:015:025 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
           against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the
           king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of
           the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.

12:015:026 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
           behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Israel.

12:015:027 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah
           the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and
           reigned twenty years.

12:015:028 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
           departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
           made Israel to sin.

12:015:029 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king
           of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah,
           and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land
           of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.

12:015:030 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
           son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in
           his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

12:015:031 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did,
           behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Israel.

12:015:032 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
           began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.

12:015:033 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and
           he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
           was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.

12:015:034 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he
           did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

12:015:035 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people
           sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He
           built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.

12:015:036 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:015:037 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the
           king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

12:015:038 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:016:001 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the
           son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

12:016:002 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned
           sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right
           in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.

12:016:003 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made
           his son to pass through the fire, according to the
           abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from
           before the children of Israel.

12:016:004 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
           the hills, and under every green tree.

12:016:005 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of
           Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz,
           but could not overcome him.

12:016:006 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
           drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and
           dwelt there unto this day.

12:016:007 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
           saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out
           of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the
           king of Israel, which rise up against me.

12:016:008 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house
           of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and
           sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.

12:016:009 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
           Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the
           people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

12:016:010 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
           Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz
           sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the
           pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.

12:016:011 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that
           king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it
           against king Ahaz came from Damascus.

12:016:012 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
           altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered
           thereon.

12:016:013 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
           poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his
           peace offerings, upon the altar.

12:016:014 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the
           LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar
           and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the
           altar.

12:016:015 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
           great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening
           meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat
           offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the
           land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and
           sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all
           the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for
           me to enquire by.

12:016:016 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
           commanded.

12:016:017 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed
           the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the
           brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the pavement
           of stones.

12:016:018 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the
           house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house
           of the LORD for the king of Assyria.

12:016:019 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

12:016:020 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in
           his stead.

12:017:001 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son
           of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.

12:017:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but
           not as the kings of Israel that were before him.

12:017:003 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
           became his servant, and gave him presents.

12:017:004 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
           sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to
           the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore
           the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

12:017:005 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
           went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

12:017:006 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
           and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah
           and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
           Medes.

12:017:007 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against
           the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land
           of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
           had feared other gods,

12:017:008 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast
           out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of
           Israel, which they had made.

12:017:009 And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were
           not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high
           places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to
           the fenced city.

12:017:010 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and
           under every green tree:

12:017:011 And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did
           the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and
           wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:

12:017:012 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye
           shall not do this thing.

12:017:013 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by
           all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from
           your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes,
           according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and
           which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.

12:017:014 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,
           like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the
           LORD their God.

12:017:015 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
           with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified
           against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and
           went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning
           whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like
           them.

12:017:016 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and
           made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove,
           and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

12:017:017 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
           the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold
           themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him
           to anger.

12:017:018 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed
           them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of
           Judah only.

12:017:019 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God,
           but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

12:017:020 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
           them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he
           had cast them out of his sight.

12:017:021 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
           Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from
           following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.

12:017:022 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
           which he did; they departed not from them;

12:017:023 Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said
           by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away
           out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.

12:017:024 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from
           Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim,
           and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the
           children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in
           the cities thereof.

12:017:025 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that
           they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among
           them, which slew some of them.

12:017:026 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The
           nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of
           Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore
           he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them,
           because they know not the manner of the God of the land.

12:017:027 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one
           of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go
           and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God
           of the land.

12:017:028 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from
           Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they
           should fear the LORD.

12:017:029 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in
           the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made,
           every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.

12:017:030 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth
           made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

12:017:031 And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites
           burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech,
           the gods of Sepharvaim.

12:017:032 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the
           lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed
           for them in the houses of the high places.

12:017:033 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the
           manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.

12:017:034 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not
           the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their
           ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD
           commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

12:017:035 With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them,
           saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to
           them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:

12:017:036 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with
           great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and
           him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.

12:017:037 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
           commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do
           for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

12:017:038 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not
           forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.

12:017:039 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you
           out of the hand of all your enemies.

12:017:040 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
           manner.

12:017:041 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven
           images, both their children, and their children's children: as
           did their fathers, so do they unto this day.

12:018:001 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah
           king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah
           began to reign.

12:018:002 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and
           he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's
           name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

12:018:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that David his father did.

12:018:004 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down
           the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses
           had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn
           incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.

12:018:005 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was
           none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were
           before him.

12:018:006 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
           but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.

12:018:007 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he
           went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and
           served him not.

12:018:008 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
           thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

12:018:009 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
           was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
           that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and
           besieged it.

12:018:010 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth
           year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of
           Israel, Samaria was taken.

12:018:011 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria,
           and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and
           in the cities of the Medes:

12:018:012 Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but
           transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of
           the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.

12:018:013 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib
           king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of
           Judah, and took them.

12:018:014 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
           Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which
           thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria
           appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of
           silver and thirty talents of gold.

12:018:015 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the
           house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.

12:018:016 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of
           the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah
           king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of
           Assyria.

12:018:017 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
           from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against
           Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when
           they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the
           upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.

12:018:018 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
           Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and
           Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

12:018:019 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
           saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
           this wherein thou trustest?

12:018:020 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and
           strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou
           rebellest against me?

12:018:021 Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised
           reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into
           his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all
           that trust on him.

12:018:022 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not
           that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath
           taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall
           worship before this altar in Jerusalem?

12:018:023 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king
           of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if
           thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

12:018:024 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
           least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
           chariots and for horsemen?

12:018:025 Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to
           destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and
           destroy it.

12:018:026 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah,
           unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the
           Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in
           the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the
           wall.

12:018:027 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
           master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me
           to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own
           dung, and drink their own piss with you?

12:018:028 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
           language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king,
           the king of Assyria:

12:018:029 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
           shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:

12:018:030 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
           LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be
           delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

12:018:031 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
           Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me,
           and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of
           his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his
           cistern:

12:018:032 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
           land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land
           of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and
           hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The
           LORD will deliver us.

12:018:033 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
           out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

12:018:034 Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods
           of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out
           of mine hand?

12:018:035 Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have
           delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should
           deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?

12:018:036 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word:
           for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

12:018:037 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
           household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph
           the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
           him the words of Rabshakeh.

12:019:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
           his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
           the house of the LORD.

12:019:002 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna
           the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with
           sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

12:019:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
           of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are
           come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

12:019:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of
           Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to
           reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the
           LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the
           remnant that are left.

12:019:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

12:019:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master,
           Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou
           hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
           have blasphemed me.

12:019:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
           rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him
           to fall by the sword in his own land.

12:019:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
           against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
           Lachish.

12:019:009 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he
           is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again
           unto Hezekiah, saying,

12:019:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
           thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem
           shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

12:019:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
           all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be
           delivered?

12:019:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
           have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
           children of Eden which were in Thelasar?

12:019:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the
           king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?

12:019:014 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the
           messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house
           of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

12:019:015 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
           Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the
           God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou
           hast made heaven and earth.

12:019:016 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes,
           and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent
           him to reproach the living God.

12:019:017 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
           nations and their lands,

12:019:018 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
           but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
           have destroyed them.

12:019:019 Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us
           out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
           that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.

12:019:020 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus
           saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to
           me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.

12:019:021 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
           virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed
           thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head
           at thee.

12:019:022 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
           hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
           even against the Holy One of Israel.

12:019:023 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast
           said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the
           height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut
           down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees
           thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders,
           and into the forest of his Carmel.

12:019:024 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of
           my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.

12:019:025 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of
           ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
           pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into
           ruinous heaps.

12:019:026 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
           dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field,
           and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as
           corn blasted before it be grown up.

12:019:027 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
           and thy rage against me.

12:019:028 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into
           mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my
           bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
           which thou camest.

12:019:029 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
           such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that
           which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and
           reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.

12:019:030 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
           yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

12:019:031 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
           escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
           do this.

12:019:032 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
           He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
           nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

12:019:033 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
           shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

12:019:034 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake,
           and for my servant David's sake.

12:019:035 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD
           went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred
           fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the
           morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

12:019:036 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
           returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

12:019:037 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
           Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
           him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.
           And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

12:020:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
           Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus
           saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die,
           and not live.

12:020:002 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
           saying,

12:020:003 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before
           thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that
           which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

12:020:004 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle
           court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,

12:020:005 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus
           saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy
           prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on
           the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.

12:020:006 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver
           thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and
           I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant
           David's sake.

12:020:007 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid
           it on the boil, and he recovered.

12:020:008 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the
           LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of
           the LORD the third day?

12:020:009 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that
           the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the
           shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?

12:020:010 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to
           go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward
           ten degrees.

12:020:011 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
           shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the
           dial of Ahaz.

12:020:012 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
           Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had
           heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

12:020:013 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the
           house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and
           the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of
           his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was
           nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah
           shewed them not.

12:020:014 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
           him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
           And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from
           Babylon.

12:020:015 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
           answered, All the things that are in mine house have they
           seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not
           shewed them.

12:020:016 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.

12:020:017 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
           that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day,
           shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith
           the LORD.

12:020:018 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
           beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
           palace of the king of Babylon.

12:020:019 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
           which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace
           and truth be in my days?

12:020:020 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and
           how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the
           city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
           the kings of Judah?

12:020:021 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:021:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and
           reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Hephzibah.

12:021:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after
           the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before
           the children of Israel.

12:021:003 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his
           father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and
           made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all
           the host of heaven, and served them.

12:021:004 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the
           LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.

12:021:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
           courts of the house of the LORD.

12:021:006 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,
           and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and
           wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD,
           to provoke him to anger.

12:021:007 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
           house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his
           son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out
           of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

12:021:008 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of
           the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe
           to do according to all that I have commanded them, and
           according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.

12:021:009 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more
           evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the
           children of Israel.

12:021:010 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,

12:021:011 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,
           and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which
           were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his
           idols:

12:021:012 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am
           bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever
           heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.

12:021:013 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
           plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a
           man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.

12:021:014 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and
           deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall
           become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;

12:021:015 Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and
           have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came
           forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.

12:021:016 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
           filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin
           wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil
           in the sight of the LORD.

12:021:017 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and
           his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of
           the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

12:021:018 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
           garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his
           son reigned in his stead.

12:021:019 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and
           he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
           Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

12:021:020 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
           his father Manasseh did.

12:021:021 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
           served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:

12:021:022 And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in
           the way of the LORD.

12:021:023 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
           king in his own house.

12:021:024 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
           against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
           son king in his stead.

12:021:025 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

12:021:026 And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and
           Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

12:022:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.

12:022:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
           walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not
           aside to the right hand or to the left.

12:022:003 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,
           that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of
           Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,

12:022:004 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver
           which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers
           of the door have gathered of the people:

12:022:005 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the
           work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and
           let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the
           house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,

12:022:006 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber
           and hewn stone to repair the house.

12:022:007 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money
           that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt
           faithfully.

12:022:008 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
           have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
           Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

12:022:009 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
           word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money
           that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the
           hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the
           house of the LORD.

12:022:010 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
           priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before
           the king.

12:022:011 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
           book of the law, that he rent his clothes.

12:022:012 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son
           of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the
           scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,

12:022:013 Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for
           all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found:
           for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us,
           because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this
           book, to do according unto all that which is written
           concerning us.

12:022:014 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan,
           and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of
           Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the
           wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and
           they communed with her.

12:022:015 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
           Tell the man that sent you to me,

12:022:016 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
           place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of
           the book which the king of Judah hath read:

12:022:017 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
           other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
           works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled
           against this place, and shall not be quenched.

12:022:018 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the
           LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of
           Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;

12:022:019 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself
           before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this
           place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should
           become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes,
           and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.

12:022:020 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and
           thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes
           shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
           And they brought the king word again.

12:023:001 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders
           of Judah and of Jerusalem.

12:023:002 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
           men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him,
           and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both
           small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of
           the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the
           LORD.

12:023:003 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the
           LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and
           his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all
           their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were
           written in this book. And all the people stood to the
           covenant.

12:023:004 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the
           priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to
           bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that
           were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of
           heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of
           Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.

12:023:005 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of
           Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the
           cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them
           also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the
           moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.

12:023:006 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD,
           without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the
           brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the
           powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.

12:023:007 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by
           the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the
           grove.

12:023:008 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
           defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense,
           from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the
           gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the
           governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the
           gate of the city.

12:023:009 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
           altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the
           unleavened bread among their brethren.

12:023:010 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children
           of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to
           pass through the fire to Molech.

12:023:011 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given
           to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by
           the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the
           suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

12:023:012 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
           Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which
           Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD,
           did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and
           cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.

12:023:013 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
           the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the
           king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of
           the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the
           Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of
           Ammon, did the king defile.

12:023:014 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves,
           and filled their places with the bones of men.

12:023:015 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place
           which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had
           made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and
           burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and
           burned the grove.

12:023:016 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that
           were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of
           the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted
           it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God
           proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.

12:023:017 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of
           the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God,
           which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou
           hast done against the altar of Bethel.

12:023:018 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they
           let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came
           out of Samaria.

12:023:019 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
           cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to
           provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them
           according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.

12:023:020 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there
           upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and
           returned to Jerusalem.

12:023:021 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the
           passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book
           of this covenant.

12:023:022 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of
           the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the
           kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;

12:023:023 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this
           passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.

12:023:024 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards,
           and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that
           were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah
           put away, that he might perform the words of the law which
           were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the
           house of the LORD.

12:023:025 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to
           the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with
           all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither
           after him arose there any like him.

12:023:026 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his
           great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,
           because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him
           withal.

12:023:027 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight,
           as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city
           Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said,
           My name shall be there.

12:023:028 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:023:029 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the
           king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went
           against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

12:023:030 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
           and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own
           sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of
           Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's
           stead.

12:023:031 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
           reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

12:023:032 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his fathers had done.

12:023:033 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of
           Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land
           to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of
           gold.

12:023:034 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the
           room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim,
           and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.

12:023:035 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
           taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment
           of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people
           of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give
           it unto Pharaohnechoh.

12:023:036 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
           reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

12:023:037 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his fathers had done.

12:024:001 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and
           Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and
           rebelled against him.

12:024:002 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands
           of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the
           children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it,
           according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his
           servants the prophets.

12:024:003 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
           remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh,
           according to all that he did;

12:024:004 And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled
           Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not
           pardon.

12:024:005 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,
           are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Judah?

12:024:006 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:024:007 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
           for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto
           the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

12:024:008 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and
           he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name
           was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

12:024:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his father had done.

12:024:010 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
           came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.

12:024:011 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and
           his servants did besiege it.

12:024:012 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
           Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his
           princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in
           the eighth year of his reign.

12:024:013 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of
           the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in
           pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel
           had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.

12:024:014 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and
           all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and
           all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest
           sort of the people of the land.

12:024:015 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's
           mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty
           of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to
           Babylon.

12:024:016 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen
           and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war,
           even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.

12:024:017 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother
           king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

12:024:018 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,
           and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

12:024:019 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

12:024:020 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
           and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that
           Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

12:025:001 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the
           tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
           Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host,
           against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built
           forts against it round about.

12:025:002 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
           Zedekiah.

12:025:003 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed
           in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the
           land.

12:025:004 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by
           night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by
           the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city
           round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.

12:025:005 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and
           overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were
           scattered from him.

12:025:006 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of
           Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.

12:025:007 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put
           out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass,
           and carried him to Babylon.

12:025:008 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which
           is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
           came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king
           of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:

12:025:009 And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and
           all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt
           he with fire.

12:025:010 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain
           of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.

12:025:011 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
           fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the
           remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the
           guard carry away.

12:025:012 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of
           the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.

12:025:013 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,
           and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the
           LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass
           of them to Babylon.

12:025:014 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
           spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
           ministered, took they away.

12:025:015 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of
           gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the
           guard took away.

12:025:016 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made
           for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was
           without weight.

12:025:017 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the
           chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter
           three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the
           chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had
           the second pillar with wreathen work.

12:025:018 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
           and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
           door:

12:025:019 And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the
           men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's
           presence, which were found in the city, and the principal
           scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and
           threescore men of the people of the land that were found in
           the city:

12:025:020 And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought
           them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:

12:025:021 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in
           the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their
           land.

12:025:022 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
           Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he
           made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.

12:025:023 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,
           heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor,
           there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
           Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son
           of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a
           Maachathite, they and their men.

12:025:024 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto
           them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in
           the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well
           with you.

12:025:025 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
           of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came,
           and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and
           the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.

12:025:026 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of
           the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of
           the Chaldees.

12:025:027 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
           captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
           on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
           king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up
           the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;

12:025:028 And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the
           throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;

12:025:029 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread
           continually before him all the days of his life.

12:025:030 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the
           king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

           Zeruiah; Abishai, and Joab, and Asahel, three.

13:002:017 And Abigail bare Amasa: and the father of Amasa was Jether the
           Ishmeelite.

13:002:018 And Caleb the son of Hezron begat children of Azubah his wife,
           and of Jerioth: her sons are these; Jesher, and Shobab, and
           Ardon.

13:002:019 And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took unto him Ephrath, which
           bare him Hur.

13:002:020 And Hur begat Uri, and Uri begat Bezaleel.

13:002:021 And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the
           father of Gilead, whom he married when he was threescore years
           old; and she bare him Segub.

13:002:022 And Segub begat Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the
           land of Gilead.

13:002:023 And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair, from
           them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, even threescore
           cities. All these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of
           Gilead.

13:002:024 And after that Hezron was dead in Calebephratah, then Abiah
           Hezron's wife bare him Ashur the father of Tekoa.

13:002:025 And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram
           the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah.

13:002:034 Now Sheshan had no sons, but daughters. And Sheshan had a
           servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Jarha.

13:002:035 And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife;

           half of the Manahethites.

13:002:053 And the families of Kirjathjearim; the Ithrites, and the
           Puhites, and the Shumathites, and the Mishraites; of them came
           the Zareathites, and the Eshtaulites,

13:002:054 The sons of Salma; Bethlehem, and the Netophathites, Ataroth,
           the house of Joab, and half of the Manahethites, the Zorites.

13:002:055 And the families of the scribes which dwelt at Jabez; the
           Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites. These are the
           Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of
           Rechab.

13:003:001 Now these were the sons of David, which were born unto him in

13:004:003 And these were of the father of Etam; Jezreel, and Ishma, and
           Idbash: and the name of their sister was Hazelelponi:

13:004:004 And Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah.
           These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, the

13:004:007 And the sons of Helah were, Zereth, and Jezoar, and Ethnan.

13:004:008 And Coz begat Anub, and Zobebah, and the families of Aharhel
           the son of Harum.

13:004:009 And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and his
           mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with
           sorrow.

13:004:010 And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou
           wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine
           hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from
           evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that
           which he requested.

13:004:011 And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir, which was the
           father of Eshton.

13:004:013 And the sons of Kenaz; Othniel, and Seraiah: and the sons of

13:004:014 And Meonothai begat Ophrah: and Seraiah begat Joab, the father
           of the valley of Charashim; for they were craftsmen.

13:004:015 And the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh; Iru, Elah, and

13:004:016 And the sons of Jehaleleel; Ziph, and Ziphah, Tiria, and
           Asareel.

           the house of them that wrought fine linen, of the house of
           Ashbea,

13:004:022 And Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who
           had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubilehem. And these are
           ancient things.

13:004:023 These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and
           hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work.

13:004:024 The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and
           Shaul:

13:004:026 And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son,
           Shimei his son.

13:004:027 And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters: but his
           brethren had not many children, neither did all their family
           multiply, like to the children of Judah.

13:004:028 And they dwelt at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,

13:004:029 And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,

13:004:030 And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,

13:004:031 And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at
           Shaaraim. These were their cities unto the reign of David.

13:004:032 And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen,
           and Ashan, five cities:

13:004:033 And all their villages that were round about the same cities,
           unto Baal. These were their habitations, and their genealogy.

13:004:034 And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah, the son of Amaziah,

13:004:035 And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah,
           the son of Asiel,

13:004:036 And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and
           Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,

13:004:037 And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of
           Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;

13:004:038 These mentioned by their names were princes in their families:
           and the house of their fathers increased greatly.

13:004:039 And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east
           side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

13:004:040 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide,
           and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of
           old.

13:004:041 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of
           Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were
           found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and
           dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for
           their flocks.

13:004:042 And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred
           men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah,
           and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

13:004:043 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped,
           and dwelt there unto this day.

13:005:001 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was
           the firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed,
           his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of
           Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the
           birthright.

13:005:002 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the
           chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

13:005:003 The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were,
           Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

13:005:004 The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his
           son,

13:005:005 Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,

13:005:006 Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried
           away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

13:005:007 And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of
           their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and
           Zechariah,

13:005:008 And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,
           who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:

13:005:009 And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the
           wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were
           multiplied in the land of Gilead.

13:005:010 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who
           fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout
           all the east land of Gilead.

13:005:011 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land
           of Bashan unto Salcah:

13:005:012 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat
           in Bashan.

13:005:013 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were,
           Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and
           Zia, and Heber, seven.

13:005:014 These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of
           Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of
           Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

13:005:015 Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of
           their fathers.

13:005:016 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in
           all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.

13:005:017 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham
           king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.

13:005:018 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of
           Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword,
           and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty
           thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the
           war.

13:005:019 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish,
           and Nodab.

13:005:020 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were
           delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for
           they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them;
           because they put their trust in him.

13:005:021 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty
           thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of
           asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.

13:005:022 For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God.
           And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

13:005:023 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the
           land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir,
           and unto mount Hermon.

13:005:024 And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even
           Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and
           Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and
           heads of the house of their fathers.

13:005:025 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and
           went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom
           God destroyed before them.

13:005:026 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of
           Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria,
           and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the
           Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto
           Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this
           day.

13:006:001 The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

13:006:002 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.

13:006:003 And the children of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam. The
           sons also of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

13:006:004 Eleazar begat Phinehas, Phinehas begat Abishua,

13:006:005 And Abishua begat Bukki, and Bukki begat Uzzi,

13:009:008 And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the
           son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son
           of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;

13:009:009 And their brethren, according to their generations, nine
           hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the
           fathers in the house of their fathers.

13:009:010 And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,

13:009:011 And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son
           of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of
           the house of God;

13:009:012 And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of
           Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah,
           the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of
           Immer;

13:009:013 And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a
           thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for
           the work of the service of the house of God.

13:009:014 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of
           Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;

13:009:015 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of
           Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;

13:009:016 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of
           Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,
           that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.

13:009:017 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and
           Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;

13:009:018 Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were
           porters in the companies of the children of Levi.

13:009:019 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of
           Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the
           Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the
           gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the
           host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.

13:009:020 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in
           time past, and the LORD was with him.

13:009:021 And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation.

13:009:022 All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were
           two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy
           in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain
           in their set office.

13:009:023 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of
           the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by
           wards.

13:009:024 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west,
           north, and south.

13:009:025 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come
           after seven days from time to time with them.

13:009:026 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set
           office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house
           of God.

13:009:027 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the
           charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning
           pertained to them.

13:009:028 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels,
           that they should bring them in and out by tale.

13:009:029 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and
           all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and
           the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

13:009:030 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the
           spices.

13:009:031 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of
           Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that
           were made in the pans.

13:009:032 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites,
           were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.

13:009:033 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the
           Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they
           were employed in that work day and night.

13:009:034 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their
           generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.

13:009:035 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's
           name was Maachah:

13:009:036 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
           Ner, and Nadab.

13:009:037 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.

13:009:038 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their
           brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

13:009:039 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat
           Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

13:009:040 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat
           Micah.

13:009:041 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea,
           and Ahaz.

13:009:042 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth,
           and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;

13:009:043 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son,
           Azel his son.

13:009:044 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam,
           Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan:
           these were the sons of Azel.

13:010:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of
           Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
           in mount Gilboa.

13:010:002 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his
           sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
           Malchishua, the sons of Saul.

13:010:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
           him, and he was wounded of the archers.

13:010:004 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
           me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse
           me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So
           Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

13:010:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
           likewise on the sword, and died.

13:010:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died
           together.

13:010:007 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw
           that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then
           they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came
           and dwelt in them.

13:010:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
           to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen
           in mount Gilboa.

13:010:009 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his
           armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about,
           to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

13:010:010 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and
           fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

13:010:011 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had
           done to Saul,

13:010:012 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of
           Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,
           and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted
           seven days.

13:010:013 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against
           the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept
           not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar
           spirit, to enquire of it;

13:010:014 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and
           turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

13:011:001 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron,
           saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

13:011:002 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast
           he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy
           God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou
           shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

13:011:003 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron;
           and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD;
           and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the
           word of the LORD by Samuel.

13:011:004 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus;
           where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

13:011:005 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not
           come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which
           is the city of David.

13:011:006 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be
           chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up,
           and was chief.

13:011:007 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the
           city of David.

13:011:008 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round
           about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

13:011:009 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was
           with him.

13:011:010 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who
           strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all
           Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD
           concerning Israel.

13:011:011 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;
           Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted
           up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.

13:011:012 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who
           was one of the three mighties.

13:011:013 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were
           gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full
           of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

13:011:014 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and
           delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved
           them by a great deliverance.

13:011:015 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to
           David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the
           Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

13:011:016 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison
           was then at Bethlehem.

13:011:017 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
           the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!

13:011:018 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and
           drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,
           and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not
           drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.

13:011:019 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing:
           shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives
           in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought
           it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these
           three mightiest.

13:011:020 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three:
           for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them,
           and had a name among the three.

13:011:021 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was
           their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.

13:011:022 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of
           Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of
           Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy
           day.

13:011:023 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits
           high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's
           beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
           spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own
           spear.

13:011:024 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
           among the three mighties.

13:011:025 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not
           to the first three: and David set him over his guard.

13:011:026 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of
           Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

13:011:027 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

13:011:028 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,

13:011:029 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

13:011:030 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the
           Netophathite,

13:011:031 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the
           children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

13:011:032 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

13:011:033 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

13:011:034 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the
           Hararite,

13:011:035 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

13:011:036 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

13:011:037 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

13:011:038 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,

13:011:039 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of
           Joab the son of Zeruiah,

13:011:040 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

13:011:041 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

13:011:042 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the
           Reubenites, and thirty with him,

13:011:043 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

13:011:044 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan
           the Aroerite,

13:011:045 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

13:011:046 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of
           Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

13:011:047 Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.

13:012:001 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet
           kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they
           were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.

13:012:002 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand
           and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a
           bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.

13:012:003 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
           Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and
           Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.

13:012:004 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and
           over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and
           Josabad the Gederathite,

13:012:005 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and
           Shephatiah the Haruphite,

13:012:006 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam,
           the Korhites,

13:012:007 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

13:012:008 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into
           the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit
           for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose
           faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the
           roes upon the mountains;

13:012:009 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

13:012:010 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

13:012:011 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

13:012:012 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

13:012:013 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.

13:012:014 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of
           the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a
           thousand.

13:012:015 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when
           it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all
           them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the
           west.

13:012:016 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the
           hold unto David.

13:012:017 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto
           them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart
           shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine
           enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of
           our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.

13:012:018 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the
           captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side,
           thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to
           thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received
           them, and made them captains of the band.

13:012:019 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with
           the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them
           not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him
           away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy
           of our heads.

13:012:020 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah,
           and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu,
           and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.

13:012:021 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they
           were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.

13:012:022 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,
           until it was a great host, like the host of God.

13:012:023 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed
           to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom
           of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.

13:012:024 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six
           thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.

13:012:025 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,
           seven thousand and one hundred.

13:012:026 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

13:012:027 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him
           were three thousand and seven hundred;

13:012:028 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's
           house twenty and two captains.

13:012:029 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
           thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the
           ward of the house of Saul.

13:012:030 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight
           hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of
           their fathers.

13:012:031 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which
           were expressed by name, to come and make David king.

13:012:032 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had
           understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do;
           the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren
           were at their commandment.

13:012:033 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with
           all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank:
           they were not of double heart.

13:012:034 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield
           and spear thirty and seven thousand.

13:012:035 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and
           six hundred.

13:012:036 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war,
           forty thousand.

13:012:037 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
           Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of
           instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty
           thousand.

13:012:038 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a
           perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel:
           and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make
           David king.

13:012:039 And there they were with David three days, eating and
           drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

13:012:040 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and
           Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels,
           and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and
           bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
           abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

13:013:001 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and
           hundreds, and with every leader.

13:013:002 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem
           good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send
           abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the
           land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites
           which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather
           themselves unto us:

13:013:003 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we
           enquired not at it in the days of Saul.

13:013:004 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
           thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

13:013:005 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt
           even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from
           Kirjathjearim.

13:013:006 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to
           Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the
           ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims,
           whose name is called on it.

13:013:007 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house
           of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

13:013:008 And David and all Israel played before God with all their
           might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries,
           and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

13:013:009 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
           forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

13:013:010 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he
           smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he
           died before God.

13:013:011 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
           upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this
           day.

13:013:012 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I
           bring the ark of God home to me?

13:013:013 So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of
           David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the
           Gittite.

13:013:014 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his
           house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of
           Obededom, and all that he had.

13:014:001 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
           cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.

13:014:002 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over
           Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his
           people Israel.

13:014:003 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more
           sons and daughters.

13:014:004 Now these are the names of his children which he had in
           Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

13:014:005 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

13:014:006 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

13:014:007 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

13:014:008 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
           over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David.
           And David heard of it, and went out against them.

13:014:009 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley
           of Rephaim.

13:014:010 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
           Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And
           the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into
           thine hand.

13:014:011 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there.
           Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine
           hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called
           the name of that place Baalperazim.

13:014:012 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
           commandment, and they were burned with fire.

13:014:013 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
           valley.

13:014:014 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him,
           Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them
           over against the mulberry trees.

13:014:015 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
           tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to
           battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of
           the Philistines.

13:014:016 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
           host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

13:014:017 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD
           brought the fear of him upon all nations.

13:015:001 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a
           place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

13:015:002 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
           Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of
           God, and to minister unto him for ever.

13:015:003 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring
           up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared
           for it.

13:015:004 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

13:015:005 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an
           hundred and twenty:

13:015:006 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two
           hundred and twenty:

13:015:007 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an
           hundred and thirty:

13:015:008 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren
           two hundred:

13:015:009 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren
           fourscore:

13:015:010 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren
           an hundred and twelve.

13:015:011 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for
           the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel,
           and Amminadab,

13:015:012 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the
           Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that
           ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the
           place that I have prepared for it.

13:015:013 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made
           a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due
           order.

13:015:014 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring
           up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

13:015:015 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
           shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded
           according to the word of the LORD.

13:015:016 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
           brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick,
           psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the
           voice with joy.

13:015:017 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
           brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of
           Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

13:015:018 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah,
           Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni,
           Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
           Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

13:015:019 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to
           sound with cymbals of brass;

13:015:020 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and
           Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on
           Alamoth;

13:015:021 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
           Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

13:015:022 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he
           instructed about the song, because he was skilful.

13:015:023 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

13:015:024 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
           Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow
           with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and
           Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

13:015:025 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
           thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.

13:015:026 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the
           ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven
           bullocks and seven rams.

13:015:027 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
           Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the
           master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him
           an ephod of linen.

13:015:028 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with
           trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and
           harps.

13:015:029 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul
           looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing:
           and she despised him in her heart.

13:016:001 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
           tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt
           sacrifices and peace offerings before God.

13:016:002 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
           and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of
           the LORD.

13:016:003 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to
           every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a
           flagon of wine.

13:016:004 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the
           ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the
           LORD God of Israel:

13:016:005 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and
           Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and
           Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with
           harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;

13:016:006 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets
           continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

13:016:007 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the
           LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

13:016:008 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his
           deeds among the people.

13:016:009 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his
           wondrous works.

13:016:010 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
           seek the LORD.

13:016:011 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

13:016:012 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
           and the judgments of his mouth;

13:016:013 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his
           chosen ones.

13:016:014 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

13:016:015 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he
           commanded to a thousand generations;

13:016:016 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his
           oath unto Isaac;

13:016:017 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel
           for an everlasting covenant,

13:016:018 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
           your inheritance;

13:016:019 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

13:016:020 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom
           to another people;

13:016:021 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
           for their sakes,

13:016:022 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

13:016:023 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day
           his salvation.

13:016:024 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works
           among all nations.

13:016:025 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is
           to be feared above all gods.

13:016:026 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made
           the heavens.

13:016:027 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness
           are in his place.

13:016:028 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
           LORD glory and strength.

13:016:029 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
           offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty
           of holiness.

13:016:030 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be
           stable, that it be not moved.

13:016:031 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let
           men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.

13:016:032 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
           rejoice, and all that is therein.

13:016:033 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of
           the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

13:016:034 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

13:016:035 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
           together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give
           thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

13:016:036 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all
           the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

13:016:037 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark
           continually, as every day's work required:

13:016:038 And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight;
           Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:

13:016:039 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the
           tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,

13:016:040 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the
           burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do
           according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which
           he commanded Israel;

13:016:041 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were
           chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the
           LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;

13:016:042 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for
           those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments
           of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.

13:016:043 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
           returned to bless his house.

13:017:001 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David
           said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars,
           but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under
           curtains.

13:017:002 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart;
           for God is with thee.

13:017:003 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came
           to Nathan, saying,

13:017:004 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt
           not build me an house to dwell in:

13:017:005 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought
           up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and
           from one tabernacle to another.

13:017:006 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to
           any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my
           people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?

13:017:007 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
           saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even
           from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my
           people Israel:

13:017:008 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and
           have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made
           thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the
           earth.

13:017:009 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will
           plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be
           moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste
           them any more, as at the beginning,

13:017:010 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
           people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.
           Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an
           house.

13:017:011 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou
           must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed
           after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish
           his kingdom.

13:017:012 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for
           ever.

13:017:013 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
           take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was
           before thee:

13:017:014 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for
           ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.

13:017:015 According to all these words, and according to all this
           vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

13:017:016 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
           am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast
           brought me hitherto?

13:017:017 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou
           hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to
           come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of
           high degree, O LORD God.

13:017:018 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy
           servant? for thou knowest thy servant.

13:017:019 O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own
           heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all
           these great things.

13:017:020 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God
           beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our
           ears.

13:017:021 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel,
           whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a
           name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations
           from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

13:017:022 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for
           ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.

13:017:023 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken
           concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established
           for ever, and do as thou hast said.

13:017:024 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for
           ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a
           God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be
           established before thee.

13:017:025 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
           him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to
           pray before thee.

13:017:026 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
           unto thy servant:

13:017:027 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy
           servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou
           blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.

13:018:001 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the
           Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out
           of the hand of the Philistines.

13:018:002 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants,
           and brought gifts.

13:018:003 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he
           went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

13:018:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven
           thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also
           houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an
           hundred chariots.

13:018:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king
           of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand
           men.

13:018:006 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians
           became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD
           preserved David whithersoever he went.

13:018:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
           of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

13:018:008 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
           brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the
           brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

13:018:009 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all
           the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

13:018:010 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his
           welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought
           against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war
           with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and
           silver and brass.

13:018:011 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver
           and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from
           Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from
           the Philistines, and from Amalek.

13:018:012 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in
           the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

13:018:013 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
           David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever
           he went.

13:018:014 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
           justice among all his people.

13:018:015 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
           the son of Ahilud, recorder.

13:018:016 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of
           Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

13:018:017 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and
           the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the
           king.

13:019:001 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
           children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

13:019:002 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
           Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David
           sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the
           servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon
           to Hanun, to comfort him.

13:019:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun,
           Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath
           sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee
           for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

13:019:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and
           cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks,
           and sent them away.

13:019:005 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were
           served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly
           ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards
           be grown, and then return.

13:019:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made
           themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon
           sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and
           horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out
           of Zobah.

13:019:007 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king
           of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.
           And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from
           their cities, and came to battle.

13:019:008 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
           the mighty men.

13:019:009 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
           array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were
           come were by themselves in the field.

13:019:010 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before
           and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put
           them in array against the Syrians.

13:019:011 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of
           Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against
           the children of Ammon.

13:019:012 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
           shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
           thee, then I will help thee.

13:019:013 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
           our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do
           that which is good in his sight.

13:019:014 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
           Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

13:019:015 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
           they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered
           into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

13:019:016 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse
           before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the
           Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain
           of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

13:019:017 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
           over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array
           against them. So when David had put the battle in array
           against the Syrians, they fought with him.

13:019:018 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
           Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty
           thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

13:019:019 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to
           the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and
           became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the
           children of Ammon any more.

13:020:001 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the
           time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of
           the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and
           came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And
           Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.

13:020:002 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and
           found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious
           stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought
           also exceeding much spoil out of the city.

13:020:003 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them
           with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so
           dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And
           David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

13:020:004 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer
           with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite
           slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they
           were subdued.

13:020:005 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the
           son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
           whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.

13:020:006 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
           stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on
           each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the
           giant.

13:020:007 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's
           brother slew him.

13:020:008 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the
           hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

13:021:001 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to
           number Israel.

13:021:002 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
           number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number
           of them to me, that I may know it.

13:021:003 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times
           so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not
           all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this
           thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?

13:021:004 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore
           Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to
           Jerusalem.

13:021:005 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.
           And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred
           thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred
           threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

13:021:006 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the
           king's word was abominable to Joab.

13:021:007 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
           Israel.

13:021:008 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
           done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity
           of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

13:021:009 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,

13:021:010 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee
           three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto
           thee.

13:021:011 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
           Choose thee

13:021:012 Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed
           before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies
           overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD,
           even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD
           destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore
           advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent
           me.

13:021:013 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall
           now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies:
           but let me not fall into the hand of man.

13:021:014 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
           Israel seventy thousand men.

13:021:015 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
           was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the
           evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay
           now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the
           threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

13:021:016 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
           stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword
           in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the
           elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon
           their faces.

13:021:017 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people
           to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil
           indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine
           hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's
           house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.

13:021:018 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that
           David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the
           threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

13:021:019 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
           name of the LORD.

13:021:020 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons
           with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

13:021:021 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and
           went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David
           with his face to the ground.

13:021:022 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this
           threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the
           LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the
           plague may be stayed from the people.

13:021:023 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord
           the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee
           the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing
           instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I
           give it all.

13:021:024 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it
           for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine
           for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.

13:021:025 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of
           gold by weight.

13:021:026 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
           burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD;
           and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of
           burnt offering.

13:021:027 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword
           again into the sheath thereof.

13:021:028 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
           the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed
           there.

13:021:029 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
           wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that
           season in the high place at Gibeon.

13:021:030 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
           afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

13:022:001 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this
           is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

13:022:002 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were
           in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones
           to build the house of God.

13:022:003 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the
           doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in
           abundance without weight;

13:022:004 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of
           Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

13:022:005 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the
           house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding
           magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I
           will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared
           abundantly before his death.

13:022:006 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build
           an house for the LORD God of Israel.

13:022:007 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my
           mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:

13:022:008 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed
           blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not
           build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood
           upon the earth in my sight.

13:022:009 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of
           rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round
           about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace
           and quietness unto Israel in his days.

13:022:010 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son,
           and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of
           his kingdom over Israel for ever.

13:022:011 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and
           build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.

13:022:012 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give
           thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law
           of the LORD thy God.

13:022:013 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
           statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with
           concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not,
           nor be dismayed.

13:022:014 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of
           the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand
           thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without
           weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I
           prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.

13:022:015 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
           workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for
           every manner of work.

13:022:016 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
           no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with
           thee.

13:022:017 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
           his son, saying,

13:022:018 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you
           rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the
           land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD,
           and before his people.

13:022:019 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;
           arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God,
           to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy
           vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name
           of the LORD.

13:023:001 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his
           son king over Israel.

13:023:002 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
           priests and the Levites.

13:023:003 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
           upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was
           thirty and eight thousand.

13:023:004 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the
           work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers
           and judges:

13:023:005 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised
           the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to
           praise therewith.

13:023:006 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,
           namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

13:023:007 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.

13:023:008 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and
           Joel, three.

13:023:009 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
           These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

13:023:010 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and
           Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

13:023:011 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and
           Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one
           reckoning, according to their father's house.

13:023:012 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

13:023:013 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,
           that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons
           for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto
           him, and to bless in his name for ever.

13:023:014 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of
           the tribe of Levi.

13:023:015 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

13:023:016 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

13:023:017 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer
           had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

13:023:018 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

13:023:019 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
           Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

13:023:020 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.

13:023:021 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;
           Eleazar, and Kish.

13:023:022 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their
           brethren the sons of Kish took them.

13:023:023 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

13:023:024 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
           even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number
           of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of
           the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and
           upward.

13:023:025 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto
           his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:

13:023:026 And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the
           tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

13:023:027 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from
           twenty years old and above:

13:023:028 Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
           service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the
           chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the
           work of the service of the house of God;

13:023:029 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat
           offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is
           baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all
           manner of measure and size;

13:023:030 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and
           likewise at even:

13:023:031 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the
           sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,
           according to the order commanded unto them, continually before
           the LORD:

13:023:032 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge
           of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the
           house of the LORD.

13:024:001 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of
           Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

13:024:002 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no
           children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's
           office.

13:024:003 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
           and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their
           offices in their service.

13:024:004 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar
           than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among
           the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house
           of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar
           according to the house of their fathers.

13:024:005 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
           governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God,
           were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

13:024:006 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the
           Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and
           Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and
           before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites:
           one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken
           for Ithamar.

13:024:007 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to
           Jedaiah,

13:024:008 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

13:024:009 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

13:024:010 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

13:024:011 The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,

13:024:012 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

13:024:013 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

13:024:014 The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

13:024:015 The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,

13:024:016 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,

13:024:017 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to
           Gamul,

13:024:018 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to
           Maaziah.

13:024:019 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into
           the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron
           their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.

13:024:020 And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of
           Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

13:024:021 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was
           Isshiah.

13:024:022 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.

13:024:023 And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
           Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

13:024:024 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.

13:024:025 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
           Zechariah.

13:024:026 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah;
           Beno.

13:024:027 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur,
           and Ibri.

13:024:028 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

13:024:029 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

13:024:030 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These
           were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.

13:024:031 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons
           of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and
           Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and
           Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger
           brethren.

13:025:001 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the
           service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun,
           who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with
           cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their
           service was:

13:025:002 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and
           Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which
           prophesied according to the order of the king.

13:025:003 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and
           Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of
           their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give
           thanks and to praise the LORD.

13:025:004 Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel,
           Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti,
           and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and
           Mahazioth:

13:025:005 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words
           of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen
           sons and three daughters.

13:025:006 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the
           house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for
           the service of the house of God, according to the king's order
           to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

13:025:007 So the number of them, with their brethren that were
           instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were
           cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

13:025:008 And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as
           the great, the teacher as the scholar.

13:025:009 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second
           to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:

13:026:001 Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was
           Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

13:026:002 And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn,
           Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

13:026:003 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.

13:026:004 Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn,

           and Nethaneel the fifth.

13:026:005 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth:
           for God blessed him.

13:026:006 Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled
           throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men
           of valour.

13:026:007 The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad,
           whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

13:026:008 All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and
           their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were
           threescore and two of Obededom.

13:026:009 And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.

13:026:010 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the
           chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father
           made him the chief;)

13:026:011 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth:
           all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

13:026:012 Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the
           chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in
           the house of the LORD.

13:026:013 And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according
           to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

13:026:014 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his
           son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out
           northward.

13:026:015 To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.

13:026:016 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the
           gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward
           against ward.

13:026:017 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward
           four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.

13:026:018 At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

13:026:019 These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore,
           and among the sons of Merari.

13:026:020 And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house
           of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.

13:026:021 As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite
           Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were
           Jehieli.

13:026:022 The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were
           over the treasures of the house of the LORD.

13:026:023 Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the
           Uzzielites:

13:026:024 And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of
           the treasures.

13:026:025 And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah
           his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith
           his son.

13:026:026 Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures
           of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief
           fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the
           captains of the host, had dedicated.

13:026:027 Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain
           the house of the LORD.

13:026:028 And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and
           Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had
           dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under
           the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.

13:026:029 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward
           business over Israel, for officers and judges.

13:026:030 And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of
           valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them
           of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of
           the LORD, and in the service of the king.

13:026:031 Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the
           Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In
           the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for,
           and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer
           of Gilead.

13:026:032 And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven
           hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the
           Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for
           every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.

13:027:001 Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the
           chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and
           their officers that served the king in any matter of the
           courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout
           all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and
           four thousand.

13:027:002 Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the
           son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four
           thousand.

           the host for the first month.

           above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son.

13:027:007 The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother
           of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course
           were twenty and four thousand.

13:027:008 The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the
           Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

13:027:009 The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of
           Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four
           thousand.

13:027:010 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the
           Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were
           twenty and four thousand.

13:027:011 The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the
           Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and
           four thousand.

13:027:012 The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the
           Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty
           and four thousand.

           Netophathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty
           and four thousand.

13:027:014 The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the
           Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course
           were twenty and four thousand.

13:027:015 The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the
           Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and
           four thousand.

13:027:016 Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the
           Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites,
           Shephatiah the son of Maachah:

13:027:017 Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites,
           Zadok:

           Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:

13:027:022 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of
           the tribes of Israel.

13:027:023 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old
           and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel
           like to the stars of the heavens.

13:027:024 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
           because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was
           the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

13:027:025 And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel:
           and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in
           the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of
           Uzziah:

13:027:026 And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of
           the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

13:027:027 And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the
           increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the
           Shiphmite:

13:027:028 And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in
           the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the
           cellars of oil was Joash:

13:027:029 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the
           Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was
           Shaphat the son of Adlai:

13:027:030 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the
           asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:
